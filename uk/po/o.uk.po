"OpenConnect server (ocserv) is an SSL VPN server. Its purpose is to be a "
"secure, small, fast and configurable VPN server. It implements the "
"OpenConnect SSL VPN protocol, and has also (currently experimental) "
"compatibility with clients using the AnyConnect SSL VPN protocol. The "
"OpenConnect protocol provides a dual TCP/UDP VPN channel, and uses the "
"standard IETF security protocols to secure it. The server is implemented "
"primarily for the GNU/Linux platform but its code is designed to be portable "
"to other UNIX variants as well.\n"
"\n"
"Ocserv's main features are security through privilege separation and "
"sandboxing, accounting, and resilience due to a combined use of TCP and UDP. "
"Authentication occurs in an isolated security module process, and each user "
"is assigned an unprivileged worker process, and a networking (tun) device. "
"That not only eases the control of the resources of each user or group of "
"users, but also prevents data leak (e.g., heartbleed-style attacks), and "
"privilege escalation due to any bug on the VPN handling (worker) process. A "
"management interface allows for viewing and querying logged-in users."

"Open Virtual Machine Tools (open-vm-tools) are the open source "
"implementation of VMware Tools. They are a set of guest operating system "
"virtualization components that enhance performance and user experience of "
"virtual machines. As virtualization technology rapidly becomes mainstream, "
"each virtualization solution provider implements their own set of tools and "
"utilities to supplement the guest virtual machine. However, most of the "
"implementations are proprietary and are tied to a specific virtualization "
"platform.\n"
"\n"
"With the Open Virtual Machine Tools project, we are hoping to solve this and "
"other related problems. The tools are currently composed of kernel modules "
"for Linux and user-space programs for all VMware supported Unix-like guest "
"operating systems. They provide several useful functions like:\n"
"\n"
"* File transfer between a host and guest\n"
"\n"
"* Improved memory management and network performance under    "
"virtualization\n"
"\n"
"* General mechanisms and protocols for communication between host and guests "
