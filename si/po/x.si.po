"xl2tpd is an implementation of the Layer 2 Tunnelling Protocol (RFC 2661). "
"L2TP allows you to tunnel PPP over UDP. Some ISPs use L2TP to tunnel user "
"sessions from dial-in servers (modem banks, ADSL DSLAMs) to back-end PPP "
"servers. Another important application is Virtual Private Networks where the "
"IPsec protocol is used to secure the L2TP connection (L2TP/IPsec, RFC 3193). "
"The L2TP/IPsec protocol is mainly used by Windows and Mac OS X clients. On "
"Linux, xl2tpd can be used in combination with IPsec implementations such as "
"Openswan. Example configuration files for such a setup are included in this "
"RPM.\n"
"\n"
"xl2tpd works by opening a pseudo-tty for communicating with pppd. It runs "
"completely in userspace but supports kernel mode L2TP.\n"
"\n"
"xl2tpd supports IPsec SA Reference tracking to enable overlapping internak "
"NAT'ed IP's by different clients (eg all clients connecting from their "
"linksys internal IP 192.168.1.101) as well as multiple clients behind the "
"same NAT router.\n"
"\n"
"xl2tpd supports the pppol2tp kernel mode operations on 2.6.23 or higher, or "
"via a patch in contrib for 2.4.x kernels.\n"

"A stream buffer is a stream-based representation of an XML info-set in Java. "
"Stream buffers are designed to: provide very efficient stream-based memory "
"representations of XML info-sets; and be created and processed using any "
"Java-based XML API. Conceptually a stream buffer is similar to the "
"representation used in the Xerces deferred DOM implementation, with the "
"crucial difference that a stream buffer does not store hierarchical "
"information like parent and sibling information. The deferred DOM "
"implementation reduces memory usage when large XML documents are parsed but "
"only a subset of the document needs to be processed. (Note that using "
"deferred DOM will be more expensive than non-deferred DOM in terms of memory "
"and processing if all the document is traversed.) Stream buffers may be used "
"as an efficient alternative to DOM where:\n"
"* most or all of an XML info-set will eventually get traversed; and/or\n"
"* targeted access to certain parts of an XML info-set are required  and need "
"to be efficiently processed using stream-based APIs like  SAX or StAX."
