"Window Maker is an X11 window manager originally designed to provide "
"integration support for the GNUstep Desktop Environment. In every way "
"possible, it reproduces the elegant look and feel of the NEXTSTEP user "
"interface. It is fast, feature rich, easy to configure, and easy to use. It "
"is also free software, with contributions being made by programmers from "
"around the world.\n"
"\n"
"Window Maker has a stable user interface since many years and comes with a "
"powerful GUI configuration editor called WPrefs, which removes the need to "
"edit text-based config files by hand. It supports running dockapps which "
"make everyday tasks such as monitoring system performance and battery usage, "
"mounting devices or connecting to the internet very easy. Please see the "
"features section for more specifics on what Window Maker can do, and how it "
"compares with other popular window managers."
