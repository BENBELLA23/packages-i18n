As new releases come out, it is recommended to install the bundled font version as there may be differences between the package and previous font versions or newer font versions not yet contemplated in the package. The \"Academicons\" font was designed by James Walsh and released (see http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) under the SIL Open Font License. This package is a redistribution of the free \"Academicons\" font with specific bindings for (La)TeX. It is inspired by and based on the fontawesome package. academicons.sty provides the generic \\aiicon command to access icons, which takes as a mandatory argument the name of the desired icon. It also provides individual direct commands for each specific icon. The full list of icons and their respective names and direct commands can be found in the manual.\n"

All three programs read in a font (either the font itself or a property list), together with a simple definition file containing lines such as '128 z acute'; they then write out a new version of the font with the requested new characters in the numerical slots specified. Great care is taken over the positioning of accents, and over the provision of kerning information for new characters; mkt1font also generates suitable \"hints\" to enhance quality at small sizes or poor resolutions.

"Arabic-Latin Modern Fixed is an extension of TeX-Gyre Latin Modern Mono 10 Regular. Every glyph and OpenType feature of the Latin Modern Mono has been retained, with minor improvements. On the other hand, we have changed the vertical metrics of the font. Although the Arabic script is designed to use the same x- size as Latin Modern Mono, the former script needs greater ascender and descender space. Every Arabic glyph in each Unicode-code block is supported (up to Unicode 7.0): Arabic, Arabic Supplement, Arabic Extended, Arabic Presentation-Forms A, and Arabic Presentation-Forms B. There are two versions of the font: otf and ttf. The ?penType version is for print applications (and usually the default for TeX). The TrueType version is for on-screen applications such as text editors. Hinting in the ttf version is much better for on-screen, at least on Microsoft Windows. The unique feature of Arabic-Latin Modern is its treatment of vowels and diacritics. Each vowel and diacritic (ALM Fixed contains a total of 68 such glyphs) may now be edited horizontally within any text editor or processor. The author believes this is the very first OpenType Arabic font ever to have this capability. Editing complex Arabic texts will now be much easier to input and to proofread.\n"

"ArmTeX is a system for typesetting Armenian text with Plain TeX or LaTeX(2e). It may be used with input: from a standard Latin keyboard without any special encoding and/or support for Armenian letters, any keyboard which uses an encoding that has Armenian letters in the second half (characters 128-255) of the extended ASCII table (for example ArmSCII8 Armenian standard), or encoded in UTF-8. Users should note that the manuals (below) mostly describe the previous (version 2.0) of the package. Updating work is still under way.\n"

In addition, it is now possible to use axodraw2 with pdfLaTeX, as well as with the LaTeX-dvips method. However with pdfLaTeX (and also LuaLaTeX and XeLaTeX), an external program, axohelp, is used to perform the geometrical calculations needed for the pdf code inserted in the output file.

Content is created in the frame environment, and each frame can be made up of a number of slides using a simple notation for specifying material to appear on each slide within a frame. Short versions of title, authors, institute can also be specified as optional parameters. Whole frame graphics are supported by plain frames. The class supports figure and table environments, transparency effects, varying slide transitions and animations. Beamer also provides compatibility with other packages like prosper. The package now incorporates the functionality of the former translator package, which is used for customising the package for use in other language environments. Beamer depends on the following other packages: atbegshi, etoolbox, hyperref, ifpdf, and pgf.\n"

"Many people preparing their resumes find the requirement \"please list five (or six, or ten) papers authored by you\". The same requirement is often stated for reports prepared by professional teams. The creation of such lists may be a cumbersome task. Even more difficult is it to support such lists over the time, when new papers are added. The BibTeX style bestpapers.bst is intended to facilitate this task. It is based on the idea that it is easier to score than to sort: We can assign a score to a paper and then let the computer select the papers with highest scores. This work was commissioned by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, United States Treasury. This package is in the public domain.\n"

In difference to its forerunner, it helps to use slanted fonts (italics), and is able to set ibidem automatically in footnotes. It will also copy all citation information, abbreviations, and register key words into lists for an automatically generated appendix. That lists could refer to page and footnote numbers. BibArts has nothing to do with BibTeX. The lists are created by bibsort. BibArts requires a program, for which source and Windows executable are provided. The program creates the bibliography without using MakeIndex or BibTeX. Its source is not written for a certain operating system.

"BibLaTeX is a complete reimplementation of the bibliographic facilities provided by LaTeX. Formatting of the bibliography is entirely controlled by LaTeX macros, and a working knowledge of LaTeX should be sufficient to design new bibliography and citation styles. BibLaTeX uses its own data backend program called \"biber\" to read and process the bibliographic data. With biber, BibLaTeX has many features rivalling or surpassing other bibliography systems. To mention a few: Full Unicode support Highly customisable sorting using the Unicode Collation Algorithm + CLDR tailoring Highly customisable bibliography labels Complex macro-based on-the-fly data modification without changing your data sources A tool mode for transforming bibliographic data sources Multiple bibliographies and lists of bibliographic information in the same document with different sorting Highly customisable data source inheritance rules Polyglossia and babel suppport for automatic language switching for bibliographic entries and citations Automatic bibliography data recoding (UTF-8 -> latin1, LaTeX macros -> UTF-8 etc) Remote data sources Highly sophisticated automatic name and name list disambiguation system Highly customisable data model so users can define their own bibliographic data types Validation of bibliographic data against a data model Subdivided and/or filtered bibligraphies, bibliographies per chapter, section etc. Apart from the features unique to BibLaTeX, the package also incorporates core features of the following packages: babelbib, bibtopic, bibunits, chapterbib, cite, inlinebib, mcite and mciteplus, mlbib, multibib, splitbib. Biber version 2.7 is required for BibLaTeX 3.7.\n"

"When studying antic and medieval literature, we may find many different texts published with the same title, or, in contrary, the same text published with different titles. To avoid confusion, scholars have published claves, which are books listing ancient texts, identifying them by an identifier -- a number or a string of text. For example, for early Christianity, we have the Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca, the Clavis Apocryphorum Novi Testamenti and other claves. It could be useful to print the identifier of a texts in one specific clavis, or in many claves. The package allows us to create new field for different claves, and to present all these fields in a consistent way.\n"

"The BibLaTeX package provides shortseries and shortjournal field, but the default styles don't use them. It also provides a mechanism to print the equivalence between short forms of fields and long fields (\\printbiblist), but this mechanism does not allow to mix between different type of short fields, for example, between short forms of journal title and short forms of series titles. This package provides a solution to these two problems: If a shortjournal field is defined, it prints it instead of the \\journal field. If a shortseries field is defined, it prints it instead of the \\series field. It provides a \\printbibshortfields command to print a list of the sort forms of the fields. This list also includes the claves defined with the biblatex-claves package version 1.2 or later.\n"

"BibTeX allows the user to store his citation data in generic form, while printing citations in a document in the form specified by a BibTeX style, to be specified in the document itself (one often needs a LaTeX citation-style package, such as natbib as well). BibTeX itself is an ASCII-only program; there is, however, a version that copes with 8-bit character sets. However, BibTeX's facilities rapidly run out as one moves away from simple ASCII (for example, in the various national sorting rules for languages expressed in different parts of ISO-8859 -- the \"ISO Latin\" series). For more flexibility, the user is urged to consider using biber with BibLaTeX to typeset its output. In fact, it is best to avoid BibTeX in favour of biber and BibLaTeX, if at all possible.\n"

The breqn package makes them work as one would expect whether or not there is an intervening line break. The single most ambitious goal of the package, however, is to support automatic linebreaking of displayed equations. Such linebreaking cannot be done without substantial changes under the hood in the way formulae are processed; the code must be watched carefully, keeping an eye on possible glitches.

This package adds three commands: \\caption*, \\captcont, and \\captcont*. Along with the \\caption command, these give full control over the caption numbering, caption text and the entries in the list-of pages. The \\caption and \\captcont commands generate list-of page entries. The \\caption and \\caption* commands increment the figure or table counter. Captcont also fully supports the subfigure package.\n"

msgstr ""

#. leap/texlive-specs-d/texlive-cfr-lm/description
msgid ""
"The package supports a number of features of the Latin Modern fonts which are not easily accessible via the default (La)TeX support provided in the official distribution. In particular, the package supports the use of the various styles of digits available, small-caps and upright italic shapes, and alternative weights and widths. It also supports variable width typewriter and the \"quotation\" font. Version 2.004 of the Latin Modern fonts is supported. By default, the package uses proportional oldstyle digits and variable width typewriter but this can be changed by passing appropriate options to the package. The package also supports using (for example) different styles of digits within a document so it is possible to use proportional oldstyle digits by default, say, but tabular lining digits within a particular table. The package requires the official Latin Modern distribution, including its (La)TeX support. The package relies on the availability of both the fonts themselves and the official font support files. The package also makes use of the nfssext-cfr package. Only the T1 and TS1 encodings are supported for text fonts. The set up of fonts for mathematics is identical to that provided by Latin Modern.\n"

"The package enhances LaTeX's cross-referencing features, allowing the format of references to be determined automatically according to the type of reference. The formats used may be customised in the preamble of a document; babel support is available (though the choice of languages remains limited: currently Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish and Ukranian). The package also offers a means of referencing a list of references, each formatted according to its type. In such lists, it can collapse sequences of numerically-consecutive labels to a reference range.\n"

Cochineal adds more than 1500 glyphs in those styles so that it is possible to make a TeX support collection that contains essentially all glyphs in all styles. Bringing the Semibold styles up the same level would have required adding about 2000 additional glyphs, which I could not even contemplate. The fonts are provided in OpenType and PostScript formats.\n"

The package depends on several other packages; while these are fairly common packages, the user should check the package's README file for the complete list.\n"

"The package CoverPage was created to supplement scientific papers with a cover page containing bibliographical information, a copyright notice, and/or some logos of the author's institution. The cover page is created (almost) automatically; this is done by parsing BibTeX information corresponding to the main document and reading a configuration file in which the author can set information like the affiliation he or she is associated with. The cover page consists of header, body and footer; all three are macros which can be redefined using \\renewcommand, thus allowing easy customization of the package. Additionally, it should be stressed that the cover page layout is totally independent of the main document and its page layout. This package requires four other packages (keyval, url, textcomp, and verbatim), but all of them are standard packages and should be part of every LaTeX installation.\n"

"An extended grid-based puzzle package, designed to take all input (both grid and clues) from the same file. The package can typeset grids with holes in them (for advertisements, or other sorts of stuff), and can deal with several sorts of puzzle: The classical puzzle contains numbers for the words and clues for the words to be filled in. The numbered puzzle contains numbers in each cell where identical numbers represent identical letters. The goal is to find out which number corresponds to which letter. The fill-in type of puzzle consists of a grid and a list of words. The goal is to place all words in the grid. Sudoku and Kakuro puzzles involve filling in grids of numbers according to their own rules. Format may be block-separated, or separated by thick lines. Input to the package is somewhat redundant: specification of the grid is separate from specification of the clues (if they're necessary). The author considers this style both 'natural' and robust.\n"

"CurVe is a class for writing a CV, with configuration for the language in which you write. The class provides a set of commands to create rubrics, entries in these rubrics etc. CurVe then format the CV (possibly splitting it onto multiple pages, repeating the titles etc), which is usually the most painful part of CV writing. Another nice feature of CurVe is its ability to manage different CV 'flavours' simultaneously. It is often the case that you want to maintain slightly divergent versions of your CV at the same time, in order to emphasize on different aspects of your background. CurVe also comes with support for use with AUC-TeX.\n"

msgid ""
"The Cyclop typeface was designed in the 1920s at the workshop of Warsaw type foundry \"Odlewnia Czcionek J. Idzkowski i S-ka\". This sans serif typeface has a highly modulated stroke so it has high typographic contrast. The vertical stems are much heavier then horizontal ones. Most characters have thin rectangles as additional counters giving the unique shape of the characters. The lead types of Cyclop typeface were produced in slanted variant at sizes 8-48 pt. It was heavily used for heads in newspapers and accidents prints. Typesetters used Cyclop in the inter-war period, during the occupation in the underground press. The typeface was used until the beginnings of the offset print and computer typesetting era. Nowadays it is hard to find the metal types of this typeface. The font was generated using the Metatype1 package. Then the original set of characters was completed by adding the full set of accented letters and characters of the modern Latin alphabets (including Vietnamese). The upright variant was generated and it was more complicated task than it appeared at the beginning. 11 upright letters of the Cyclop typeface were presented in the book by Filip Trzaska, \"Podstawy techniki wydawniczej\" (\"Foundation of the publishing techonology\"), Warsaw 1967. But even the author of the book does not know what was the source of the presented examples. The fonts are distributed in the Type1 and OpenType formats along with the files necessary for use these fonts in TeX and LaTeX including encoding definition files: T1 (ec), T5 (Vietnamese), OT4, QX, texnansi and nonstandard ones (IL2 for Czech fonts).\n"

"This package provides commands for formatting dates, times and time zones and redefines \\today to use the same formatting style. In addition to \\today, you can also use \\DTMcurrenttime (current time) or \\DTMnow (current date and time). Dates and times can be saved for later use. The accompanying datetime2- calc package can be used to convert date-times to UTC+00:00. Language and regional support is provided by independently maintained and installed modules. The datetime2-calc package uses the pgfcalendar package (part of the PGF/TikZ bundle). This package replaces datetime.sty which is now obsolete.\n"

For mixed partial derivatives, the overall order (algebraic or numeric) is calculated by the package. Optional arguments allow the easy specification of a point of evaluation for ordinary derivatives, or variables held constant for partial derivatives, and the placement of the differentiand (in the numerator or appended). Some tweaking of the display is possible through key = value settings. Secondary commands provide analogous coefficients constructed from D, \\Delta and \\delta and a command for writing Jacobians. diffcoeffx.sty is diffcoeff.sty 'on steroids', extending that package in ways that are probably unnecessary but have a certain logical force.

Further requirements were support for seasons of tv series and a list with all faulty or missing programs for rerecording.

As a result, the class is not limited to DVDs--you can of course typeset archives of CD-ROMs, Audio-CDs and so on.

"The EC fonts are European Computer Modern Fonts, supporting the complete LaTeX T1 encoding defined at the 1990 TUG conference hold at Cork/Ireland. These fonts are intended to be stable with no changes being made to the tfm files. The set also contains a Text Companion Symbol font, called tc, featuring many useful characters needed in text typesetting, for example oldstyle digits, currency symbols (including the newly created Euro symbol), the permille sign, copyright, trade mark and servicemark as well as a copyleft sign, and many others. Recent releases of LaTeX2e support the EC fonts. The EC fonts supersede the preliminary version released as the DC fonts. The fonts are available in (traced) Adobe Type 1 format, as part of the cm-super bundle. The other Computer Modern-style T1-encoded Type 1 set, Latin Modern, is not actually a direct development of the EC set, and differs from the EC in a number of particulars.\n"

Ressler and can generate TikZ and PSTricks code. ESK behaves in a similar fashion to EMP (which encapsulates MetaPost files), and was in fact developed from it.\n"

"Around 2008, researcher Byron Cook and several colleagues began developing a new set of interrelated algorithms capable of automatically reasoning about the behavior of computer programs and other systems (such as biological systems, circuit designs, etc). At the center of these algorithms were new ideas about the relationships between structures expressable as mathematical sets and relations. Using the language of mathematics and logic, the researchers communicated these new results to others in their community via published papers, research talks, etc. Unfortunately, they found the symbols already available for reasoning about relations lacking (in contrast to sets, which have a long-ago developed and robust symbol vocabulary). Early presentations were unnecessarily cluttered. To more elegantly express these ideas around relations, Cook recruited artist Tauba Auerbach to help develop a set of symbols. This package provides an math symbol font for describing relations between ordered pairs by using Metafont.\n"

Annotations like this should be visible during the development or reviewing phase, but should normally disappear in the final version of the document. FiXme is designed to ease and automate the process of managing collaborative annotations, by offering a set of predefined note levels and layouts, the possibility to register multiple authors, to reference annotations by listing and indexing etc. FiXme is extensible, giving you the possibility to create new layouts or even complete \"themes\", and also comes with support for AUC-TeX.\n"

"TeX macros for converting Adobe Font Metric files to TeX metric and virtual font format. Fontinst helps mainly with the number crunching and shovelling parts of font installation. This means in practice that it creates a number of files which give the TeX metrics (and related information) for a font family that (La)TeX needs to do any typesetting in these fonts. Fontinst furthermore makes it easy to create fonts containing glyphs from more than one base font, taking advantage of (e.g.) \"expert\" font sets. Fontinst cannot examine files to see if they contain any useful information, nor automatically search for files or work with binary file formats; those tasks must normally be done manually or with the help of some other tool, such as the pltotf and vptovf programs.\n"

Note that it is not my aim to exactly reproduce the outlines of the original Adobe fonts. The SC and OsF in the FPL Fonts were designed with the glyphs from URW Palladio L as starting point. For some glyphs (e.g. 'o') I got the best result by scaling and boldening. For others (e.g. 'h') shifting selected portions of the character gave more satisfying results. All this was done using the free font editor FontForge. The kerning data in these fonts comes from Walter Schmidt's improved Palatino metrics.

"The package provides the means of writing code in a modular fashion: big macros or functions are divided into small chunks (called gates) with names, which can be externally controlled (e.g. they can be disabled, subjected to conditionals, loops...) and/or augmented with new chunks. Thus complex code may easily be customised without having to rewrite it, or even understand its implementation: the behavior of existing gates can be modified, and new ones can be added, without endangering the whole design. This allows code to be hacked in ways the original authors might have never envisioned. The gates package is implemented independently for both TeX and Lua. The TeX implementation, running in any current environment, requires the texapi package, whereas the Lua version can be run with any Lua interpreter, not just LuaTeX.\n"

An additional package, glossaries-accsupp, can make use of the accsupp package mechanisms for accessibility support for PDF files containing glossaries. The user may define new glossary styles, and preambles and postambles can be specified. There is provision for loading a database of terms, but only terms used in the text will be added to the relevant glossary. The package uses an indexing program to provide the actual glossary; either makeindex or xindy may serve this purpose, and a Perl script is provided to serve as interface. This package requires the mfirstuc package. The package supersedes the author's glossary package (which is now obsolete), and a conversion tool is provided.\n"

"HEPparticles is a set of macros for typesetting high energy particle names, to meet the following criteria: 1. The main particle name is a Roman or Greek symbol, to be typeset in upright font in normal contexts. 2. Additionally a superscript and/or subscript may follow the main symbol. 3. Particle resonances may also have a resonance specifier which is typeset in parentheses following the main symbol. In general the parentheses may also be followed by sub- and superscripts. 4. The particle names are expected to be used both in and out of mathematical contexts. 5. If the surrounding text is bold or italic then the particle name should adapt to that context as best as possible (this may not be possible for Greek symbols). A consequence of point 5 is that the well-known problems with boldness of particle names in section titles, headers and tables of contents automatically disappear if these macros are used.\n"

"XMP (eXtensible Metadata Platform) is a mechanism proposed by Adobe for embedding document metadata within the document itself. The metadata is designed to be easy to extract, even by programs that are oblivious to the document's file format. Most of Adobe's applications store XMP metadata when saving files. Now, with the hyperxmp package, it is trivial for LaTeX document authors to store XMP metadata in their documents as well. Version 2.2 of the package added support for the IPTC Photo Metadata schema. It allows \\xmpcomma and \\xmpquote to be used in any hyperxmp option, not only those that require special treatment of commas. And it introduces an \\xmplinesep macro that controls how multiline fields are represented in the XMP packet. The package integrates seamlessly with hyperref and requires virtually no modifications to documents that already exploit hyperref's mechanisms for specifying PDF metadata. The current version of hyperxmp can embed the following metadata as XMP: title, authors, primary author's title or position, metadata writer, subject/summary, keywords, copyright, license URL, document base URL, document identifier and instance identifier, language, source file name, PDF generating tool, PDF version, and contact telephone number/postal address/email address/URL. Hyperxmp currently embeds XMP only within PDF documents; it is compatible with pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, LaTeX+dvipdfm, and LaTeX+dvips+ps2pdf.\n"

The present package offers a collection of conversions of existing patterns to UTF-8 format, together with converters for use with 8-bit fonts in older systems. Since hyphenation patterns for Knuthian-style TeX systems are only read at iniTeX time, it is hoped that the UTF-8 patterns, with their converters, will completely supplant the older patterns.\n"

#. leap/texlive-specs-m/texlive-ionumbers/description
msgid ""
"'ionumbers' stands for 'input/output numbers'. The package restyles numbers in maths mode. If a number in the input file is written, e.g., as $3,231.44$ as commonly used in English texts, the package is able to restyle it to be output as $3\\,231{,}44$ as commonly used in German texts (and vice versa). This may be useful, for example, if you have a large table and want to include it in texts with different output conventions without the need to change the table. The package can also automatically group digits left of the decimal separator (thousands) and right of the decimal separator (thousandths) in triplets without the need of specifing commas (English) or points (German) as separators. E.g., the input $1234.567890$ can be output as $1\\,234.\\,567\\,890$. Finally, an e starts the exponent of the number. For example, $21e6$ may be output as $26\\times10\\,^{6}$.\n"

"This is a Greek font written in Metafont, with inspiration from the Bodoni typefaces in old books. It is stylistically a little more exotic than the standard textbook Greek fonts, particularly in glyphs like the lowercase rho and kappa. It aims for a rather calligraphic feel, but seems to blend well with Computer Modern. There is a ligature scheme which automatically inserts the breathings required for ancient texts, making the input text more readable than in some schemes.\n"

Macro support in standard LaTeX encodings is offered through the latex-cyrillic and t2 bundles, and the package itself offers support for other (more traditional) encodings. The fonts, in the standard T2* and X2 encodings are available in Adobe Type 1 format, in the CM-Super family of fonts. The package also offers its own LaTeX support for OT2 encoded fonts, CM bright shaped fonts and Concrete shaped fonts.\n"

Once the list is read, its items are stored in a structure that behaves as a dimensioned array. As such, it becomes very easy to access an item in the list by its number. For example, if the list is stored in the macro \\foo, the item #3 is designated by \\foo[3]. A component may, in turn, be a list with a parsing delimiter different from the parent list, paving the way for nesting and employing a syntax reminiscent of an array of several dimensions of the type \\foo[3,2] to access the item #2 of the list contained within the item #3 of the top-tier list.\n"

The class also provides the functionality of over thirty of the more popular packages, thus simplifying document sources. The class automatically loads an associated patch file mempatch; the patch file may be updated from time to time, between releases of the class itself. (The patch file stays around even when there are no extant patches.) Users who wish to use the hyperref package, in a document written with the memoir class, should also use the memhfixc package (part of this bundle). Note, however, that any current version of hyperref actually loads the package automatically if it detects that it is running under memoir.\n"

Metaplot also includes a very flexible set of macros for generating plot axes, which may be useful in other contexts as well. Presently, MetaPlot is in something of a pre-release beta state; it is quite functional, but the syntax of the commands is still potentially in flux.\n"

MathGL. is a fast and efficient library by Alexey Balakin for the creation of high-quality publication-ready scientific graphics. Although it defines interfaces for many programming languages, it also implements its own scripting language, called MGL, which can be used independently.\n"

These features may be applied to customisable sets of fonts, and all micro- typographic aspects of the fonts can be configured in a straight-forward and flexible way. Settings for various fonts are provided. Note that character protrusion requires pdfTeX, LuaTeX, or XeTeX. Font expansion works with pdfTeX or LuaTeX. The package will by default enable protrusion and expansion if they can safely be assumed to work. Disabling ligatures requires pdfTeX or LuaTeX, while the adjustment of interword spacing and of kerning only works with pdfTeX. Letterspacing is available with pdfTeX or LuaTeX. The alternative package `letterspace', which also works with plain TeX, provides the user commands for letterspacing only, omitting support for all other extensions.\n"

This font has two intended use cases: as a Gothic display font; and for emulating late-medieval manuscripts. In addition to the basic textura letters, the font contains a large number of abbreviation sigla as well as a set of Lombardic initials. As modern typesetting algorithms are not intended for creating 15th century style layout, the package contains a XeLaTeX style file that makes it easier to achieve the classic incunabula look.\n"

"MonTeX provides Mongolian and Manju support for the TeX/LaTeX community. Mongolian is a language spoken in North East Asia, namely Mongolia and the Inner Mongol Autonomous Region of China. Today, it is written in an extended Cyrillic alphabet in Mongolia whereas the Uighur writing continues to be in use in Inner Mongolia, though it is also, legally speaking, the official writing system of Mongolia. Manju is another language of North East Asia, belonging to the Tungusic branch of the Altaic languages. Though it is hardly spoken nowadays, it survives in written form as Manju was the native language of the rulers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) in China. Large quantities of documents of the Imperial Archives survive, as well as some of the finest dictionaries ever compiled in Asia, like the Pentaglot, a dictionary comprising Manju, Tibetan, Mongolian, Uighur and Chinese. MonTeX provides all necessary characters for writing standard Mongolian in Cyrillic and Classical (aka Traditional or Uighur) writing, and Manju as well as transliterated Tibetan texts, for which purpose a number of additional characters was created. In MonTeX, both Mongolian and Manju are entered in romanized form. The retransliteration (from Latin input to Mongolian and Manju output) is completely realized in TeX/Metafont so that no external preprocessor is required. Please note that most of the enhanced functions of MonTeX require a working e-LaTeX environment. This is especially true when compiling documents with Mongolian or Manju as the main document language. It is recommended to choose pdfelatex as the resulting PDF files are truly portable. Vertical text generated by MonTeX is not supported in DVI.\n"

This version of MusixTeX builds upon work by Andreas Egler, whose own version is no longer being developed. The MusiXTeX macros are universally acknowledged to be challenging to use directly: the pmx preprocessor compiles a simpler input language to MusixTeX macros..\n"

"The package includes an archive containing a MusiXTeX extension library musixtnt and C source code, binaries for Windows (32 bit and 64 bit) and MacOSX, and documentation for two programs: fixmsxpart and msxlint. musixtnt.tex provides a macro \\TransformNotes that enables transformations of the effect of notes commands such as \\notes. In general, the effect of \\TransformNotes{input}{output} is that notes commands in the source will expect their arguments to match the input pattern, but the notes will be typeset according to the output pattern. An example is extracting single-instrument parts from a multi- instrument score. fixmsxpart corrects note spacing in a single- part MusiXTeX source (possibly derived from a multi-instrument score and as a result having irregular note spacing). msxlint detects incorrectly formatted notes lines in a MusiXTeX source file. This should be used before using \\TransformNotes.\n"

Printing of catalogues of fonts and test samples of font families; the interactive macro \\showfonts shows all font families you have installed via OFS. The user interface is the same for Plain TeX and for LaTeX, but the implementation differs: the LaTeX variant of OFS uses NFSS, but the Plain variant implements its own font management (which may even be better than NFSS) Support for math fonts including TX fonts.\n"

"This small library provides a standard set of environments for writing optimization problems. It automatically aligns the problems in three points with an optional fourth: Beginning of the words \"minimize/argmin\" and \"subject to\" The objective function and the longest left hand side of the constraints The $= | > | <$ signs of the constraints. Optionally, the user can add manually a double align character && to align some common constraints feature. A clear example could be the constraints names, e.g. (boundary constraint) alignment with (dynamic constraint). Furthermore, it provides an easy interface to define optimization problem for three different reference situations: Where no equation is referenced/numbered. Where the problem is referenced with a single number. Where each equation has an individual reference. Finally, it also allows a definition of any optimization problem without a limitless number of constraints.\n"

"Pkfix is a useful utility for replacing resolution-dependent bitmapped fonts in a dvips-produced PostScript file with the corresponding resolution-independent vector fonts. Unfortunately, pkfix needs to parse certain PostScript comments that appear only in files produced by dvips versions later than 5.58 (ca. 1996); it fails to work on PostScript files produced by older versions of dvips. Pkfix-helper is a program that attempts to insert newer-dvips comments into an older-dvips PostScript file, thereby making the file suitable for processing by pkfix. pkfix-helper can sometimes process documents fully autonomously but does require the user to verify and, if needed, correct its decisions.\n"

"The package contains the Antykwa Poltawskiego family of fonts in the PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats. The original font was designed in the twenties of the XX century by the Polish typographer Adam Poltawski(1881-1952). Following the route set out by the Latin Modern and TeX Gyre projects (http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry), the Antykwa Poltawskiego digitisation project aims at providing a rich collection of diacritical characters in the attempt to cover as many Latin-based scripts as possible. To our knowledge, the repertoire of characters covers all European languages as well as some other Latin-based alphabets such as Vietnamese and Navajo; at the request of users, recent extensions (following the enhancement of the Latin Modern collection) provide glyphs sufficient for typesetting of romanized transliterations of Arabic and Sanskrit scripts. The Antykwa Poltawskiego family consists of 4 weights (light, normal, medium, bold), each having upright and italic forms and one of 5 design sizes: 6, 8, 10, 12 and 17pt. Altogether, the collection comprises 40 font files, containing the same repertoire of 1126 characters.

For example, if babel is used, it is possible to define different replacements corresponding to different languages.

"A small package that makes LaTeX default to 'standard' PostScript fonts. It is basically a merger of the times and the (obsolete) mathptm packages from the psnfss suite. You must have installed standard LaTeX and the psnfss PostScript fonts to use this package. The main novel feature is that the pslatex package tries to compensate for the visual differences between the Adobe fonts by scaling Helvetica by 90%, and 'condensing' Courier (i.e. scaling horizontally) by 85%. The package is supplied with a (unix) shell file for a 'pslatex' command that allows standard LaTeX documents to be processed, without needing to edit the file. Note that current psnfss uses a different technique for scaling Helvetica, and treats Courier as a lost cause (there are better free fixed-width available now, than there were when pslatex was designed). As a result, pslatex is widely considered obsolete.\n"

"Font definition files, macros and font metrics for freely- available Adobe Type 1 fonts. The font set consists of the 'LaserWriter 35' set (originally 'freely available' because embedded in PostScript printers), and a variety of other free fonts, together with some additions. Note that while many of the fonts are available in PostScript (and other) printers, most publishers require fonts embedded in documents, which requires that you have the fonts in your TeX system. Fortunately, there are free versions of the fonts from URW (available in the URW base5 bundle). The base set of text fonts covered by PSNFSS are: AvantGarde, Bookman, Courier, Helvetica, New Century Schoolbook, Palatino, Symbol, Times Roman and Zapf Dingbats. In addition, the fonts Bitstream Charter and Adobe Utopia are covered (those fonts were contributed to the Public Domain by their commercial foundries). Separate packages are provided to load each font for use as main text font. The packages helvet (which allows Helvetica to be loaded with its size scaled to something more nearly appropriate for its use as a Sans-Serif font to match Times) and pifont (which provides the means to select single glyphs from symbol fonts) are tailored to special requirements of their fonts. Mathematics are covered by the mathptmx package, which constructs passable mathematics from a combination of Times Roman, Symbol and some glyphs from Computer Modern, and by Pazo Math (optionally extended with the fpl small-caps and old-style figures fonts) which uses Palatino as base font, with the mathpazo fonts. The bundle as a whole is part of the LaTeX 'required' set of packages.\n"

"Pst-cox is a PSTricks package for drawing 2-dimensional projections of complex regular polytopes (after the work of Coxeter). The package consists of a macro library for drawing the projections. The complex polytopes appear in the study of the root systems and play a crucial role in many domains related to mathematics and physics. These polytopes have been completely described by Coxeter in his book \"Regular Complex Polytopes\". There exist only a finite numbers of exceptional regular complex polytopes (for example the icosahedron) and some infinite series (for example, one can construct a multi- dimensional analogue of the hypercube in any finite dimension). The library contains two packages. The first, pst-coxcoor, is devoted to the exceptional complex regular polytopes whose coordinates have been pre-computed. The second, pst-coxeterp, is devoted to the infinite series.\n"

"Produce Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF) from a one- page PostScript document, or any PostScript document.

The input is cropped to include just the image contained in the PostScript file. The EPS files can then be included into TeX documents. Other programs like ps2epsi (a script distributed with ghostscript) don't always calculate the correct bounding box (because the values are put on the PostScript stack which may get corrupted by bad PostScript code) or they round it off, resulting in clipping the image. Therefore ps2eps uses a resolution of 144 dpi to get the correct bounding box. The bundle includes binaries for Linux, Solaris, Digital Unix or Windows 2000/9x/NT; for other platforms, the user needs perl, ghostscript and an ANSI-C compiler. Included in the distribution is the bbox program, an application to produce Bounding Box values for rawppm or rawpbm format files.\n"

"PSTricks offers an extensive collection of macros for generating PostScript that is usable with most TeX macro formats, including Plain TeX, LaTeX, AMS-TeX, and AMS-LaTeX. Included are macros for colour, graphics, pie charts, rotation, trees and overlays. It has many special features, including a wide variety of graphics (picture drawing) macros, with a flexible interface and with colour support. There are macros for colouring or shading the cells of tables. The package pstricks-add contains bug-fixes and additions for PSTricks (among other things). PSTricks ordinarily uses PostScript \\special commands, which are not supported by pdf(La)TeX. This limitation may be overcome by using either the pst-pdf or the pdftricks package, to generate a PDF inclusion from a PSTricks diagram. PSTricks macros can also generate PDF output when the document is processed XeTeX, without the need for other supporting packages. Note that this is one of a pair of catalogue entries for PSTricks; the other one (PSTricks) is acting as a \"stub\", while editorial work on catalogue entries for PSTricks contributed is completed.\n"

Errors and warnings are synchronized with the LaTeX document, so that they refer to the document's line numbers. External dependencies can be tracked, so that code is re-executed when the data it depends on is modified. PythonTeX also provides syntax highlighting for code in LaTeX documents via the Pygments syntax highlighter. The package provides a depythontex utility, that creates a copy of the document in which all Python code has been replaced by its output.

For this one would need a viewport occupying exactly one half of the file's bounding box, whatever the actual width of the image may be.

"This collection of files contains LaTeX packages for posters of ISO A3 size and larger (ISO A0 is the default size). American paper sizes and custom paper are supported. In particular, sciposter.cls defines a document class which allows cutting and pasting most of an article to a poster without any editing (save reducing the size) -- see the manual. Sciposter does work for LaTeX, not just pdfLaTeX. However, xdvi produces strange results, though a recent version of dvips does create good ps- files from the dvi files. Also note that logos must either be put in the current working directory or in the directories of your LaTeX distribution. For some reason graphicspath settings are ignored.\n"

"The package suppresses typographic ligatures selectively, i.e., based on predefined search patterns.

For example, the word shelfful, which is mentioned in the TeXbook as a word for which the ff ligature might be inappropriate, is automatically typeset as shelf\\/ful rather than as shel{ff}ul. For English and German language documents, the package provides extensive rules for the selective suppression of so-called \"common\" ligatures. These comprise the ff, fi, fl, ffi, and ffl ligatures as well as the ft and fft ligatures. Other f-ligatures, such as fb, fh, fj and fk, are suppressed globally, while exceptions are made for names and words of non-English/German origin, such as Kafka and fjord. For English language documents, the package further provides ligature suppression macros for a number of so-called \"discretionary\" or \"rare\" ligatures such as ct, st, and sp. The package requires use of a recent LuaLaTeX format (for example those from TeX Live 2012 or 2013, or MiKTeX 2.9).\n"

"Typesetting values with units requires care to ensure that the combined mathematical meaning of the value plus unit combination is clear. In particular, the SI units system lays down a consistent set of units with rules on how they are to be used. However, different countries and publishers have differing conventions on the exact appearance of numbers (and units). A number of LaTeX packages have been developed to provide consistent application of the various rules: SIunits, sistyle, unitsdef and units are the leading examples. The numprint package provides a large number of number-related functions, while dcolumn and rccol provide tools for typesetting tabular numbers. The siunitx package takes the best from the existing packages, and adds new features and a consistent interface. A number of new ideas have been incorporated, to fill gaps in the existing provision. The package also provides backward-compatibility with SIunits, sistyle, unitsdef and units. The aim is to have one package to handle all of the possible unit-related needs of LaTeX users. The package relies on LaTeX 3 support from the l3kernel and l3packages bundles.\n"

As a side effect, using the document classes provided, it hides a lot of LaTeX from someone who just wants to write articles and books.\n"

"Typeset matrices and arrays with spaces and semicolons as delimiters. The purpose of this package is to decrease the number of keystrokes needed to typeset small amounts of aligned material (matrices, arrays, etc.). It provides a facility for typing alignment environments and macros with spaces as the alignment delimiter and semicolons (by default) as the end-of- row indicator. For instance, typeset a matrix using \\spalignmat{1 12 -3; 24 -2 2; 0 0 1}, or a vector using \\spalignvector{22 \\frac{1}{2} -14}. This package also contains utility macros for typesetting augmented matrices, vectors, arrays, systems of equations, and more, and is easily extendable to other situations that use alignments. People who have to typeset a large number of matrices (like linear algebra teachers) should find this package to be a real time saver.\n"

"Knuth designed his original fonts with tabular figures (figures whose width is uniform); this makes some layout problems rather simple. In more recent times, fonts (such as Minion Pro), which offer proportionally spaced figures, are increasingly being used. The package provides mechanisms whereby such proportional figures may still be aligned in tabular style (for example, in the table of contents).\n"

"The package provides an environment, tabu, which will make any sort of tabular (that doesn't need to split across pages), and an environment longtabu which provides the facilities of tabu in a modified longtable environment.

The package requires the array package, and needs e-TeX to run (since array.sty is present in every conforming distribution of LaTeX, and since every publicly available LaTeX format is built using e-TeX, the requirements are provided by default on any reasonable system). The package also requires xcolor for coloured rules in tables, and colortbl for coloured cells. The longtabu environment further requires that longtable be loaded. The package itself does not load any of these packages for the user. The tabu environment may be used in place of tabular, tabular* and tabularx environments, as well as the array environment in maths mode. It overloads tabularx's X-column specification, allowing a width specification, alignment (l, r, c and j) and column type indication (p, m and b). \\begin{tabu} to <dimen> specifies a target width, and \\begin{tabu} spread <dimen> enlarges the environment's \"natural\" width.\n"

"The talk document class allows you to create slides for screen presentations or printing on transparencies. It also allows you to print personal notes for your talk. You can create overlays and display structure information (current section / subsection, table of contents) on your slides. The main feature that distinguishes talk from other presentation classes like beamer or prosper is that it allows the user to define an arbitrary number of slide styles and switch between these styles from slide to slide. This way the slide layout can be adapted to the slide content. For example, the title or contents page of a talk can be given a slightly different layout than the other slides. The talk class makes no restrictions on the slide design whatsoever. The entire look and feel of the presentation can be defined by the user. The style definitions should be put in a separate sty file. Currently the package comes with only one set of pre-defined slide styles (greybars.sty). Contributions from people who are artistically more gifted than the author are more than welcome!\n"

The second displays each token of the list (one per line) with its catcode (in the list, not just the current one), and can be useful for debugging or for TeX learners. Ted is designed to work well even if strange tokens (that is, unusual {charcode, catcode} pairs or tokens with a confusing meaning) occur in the list.\n"

TeX Gyre Chorus is based on URW Chancery L Medium Italic (from ITC Zapf Chancery, designed by Hermann Zapf in 1979). TeX-Gyre Cursor is based on URW Nimbus Mono L (based on Courier, designed by Howard G. Kettler in 1955, for IBM). TeX Gyre Heros is based on URW Nimbus Sans L (from Helvetica, prepared by Max Miedinger, with Eduard Hoffmann in 1957). TeX Gyre Pagella is based on URW Palladio L (from Palatino, designed by Hermann Zapf in the 1940s). TeX Gyre Schola is based on the URW Century Schoolbook L family (which was designed by Morris Fuller Benton for the American Type Founders). TeX Gyre Termes is based on the URW Nimbus Roman No9 L family of fonts (whose original, Times, was designed by Stanley Morison together with Starling Burgess and Victor Lardent and first offered by Monotype). The constituent standard faces of each family have been greatly extended, and contain nearly 1100 glyphs each (though Chorus omits Greek support, has no small-caps family and has approximately 800 glyphs). Each family is available in Adobe Type 1 and Open Type formats, and LaTeX support (for use with a variety of encodings) is provided. Vietnamese characters were added by Han The Thanh.\n"

In fact, since modern distributions will automatically generate any bitmap font you might need, type1cm has wider application than just those using scaleable versions of the fonts.

Font-set definition takes the form of a set of options that are read when the package is loaded: for each typographic category (main body font, sans-serif font, monospace font, mathematics fonts, text figures, and so on), a font or a transformation is given in those options. The approach enables the user to remember their own configurations (as a single command) and to borrow configurations that other users have developed. The present release is designated \"for review\".\n"

"Xdoc is a project to rewrite the implementation of the LaTeX doc package (in a broader sense) to make its features more general and flexible. For example, where doc only provides commands for documenting macros and environments, xdoc also provides commands for similarly documenting package options and switches. This is furthermore done in such a way that it is very easy to add more such commands for documenting things, such as e.g., templates (an important concept in the future LaTeX3) and program components for other languages (functions, classes, procedures, etc.). A side effect is that many minor bugs in doc are fixed. The design aims to take advantage of many still experimental features of future versions of LaTeX, but since these are neither reasonably stable nor widely available, the configuration interfaces and package author commands of xdoc are likely to change. To still provide a stable interface for other packages to build upon, the actual package names include a \"major version number\" of sorts. The drop-in replacement package for standard doc is xdoc2; it requires nothing outside standard LaTeX2e. The docindex/docidx2e package changes the index and list of changes typesetting so that none of the formatting has to be controlled via the index style file. The docindex package provides control of formatting via templates (nice interface, but requires several experimental packages), whereas the docidx2e package has traditional raw macro interfaces and works with standard LaTeX2e.\n"

It's evident that it's not going to work in it's current form, and I don't have the skills or time to update it. I know the general concept is very important, and so I'm looking at getting support from various funding agencies to employ someone to completely refactor the code in a more future-proof fashion.

Every Arabic glyph in each Unicode-code block is supported (up to Unicode 7.0): Arabic, Arabic Supplement, Arabic Extended, Arabic Presentation-Forms A, and Arabic Presentation-Forms B. There are two versions of the font: otf and ttf. The ?penType version is for print applications (and usually the default for TeX). The TrueType version is for on-screen applications such as text editors. Hinting in the ttf version is much better for on-screen, at least on Microsoft Windows. The unique feature of Arabic-Latin Modern is its treatment of vowels and diacritics. Each vowel and diacritic (ALM Fixed contains a total of 68 such glyphs) may now be edited horizontally within any text editor or processor.

AMS-TeX is no longer supported by the AMS, nor is it used by the AMS publishing program. The AMS does not recommend creating any new documents using AMS-TeX; this distribution will be left on CTAN to facilitate processing of legacy documents and as a historical record of a pioneering TeX macro collection that played a key role in popularizing TeX and revolutionizing mathematics publishing. In addition to the \"User's Guide to AMS-TeX\", the AMS has also made the full text of the most recent reprint of the second edition of \"The Joy of TeX\" by Michael Spivak available as a pdf file. AMS-TeX is the historical basis of amslatex, which should now be used to prepare submissions for the AMS."

In particular, the package supports the use of the various styles of digits available, small-caps and upright italic shapes, and alternative weights and widths. It also supports variable width typewriter and the \"quotation\" font. Version 2.004 of the Latin Modern fonts is supported. By default, the package uses proportional oldstyle digits and variable width typewriter but this can be changed by passing appropriate options to the package. The package also supports using (for example) different styles of digits within a document so it is possible to use proportional oldstyle digits by default, say, but tabular lining digits within a particular table. The package requires the official Latin Modern distribution, including its (La)TeX support. The package relies on the availability of both the fonts themselves and the official font support files. The package also makes use of the nfssext-cfr package. Only the T1 and TS1 encodings are supported for text fonts. The set up of fonts for mathematics is identical to that provided by Latin Modern."

(The m4 and pic processors are readily available for Unix and PC machines.) Alternative output macros can create TeX output to be read by pstricks, TikZ commands for use by the pgf bundle, or SVG."

A conditional content, in the sense within this is understood in this package, is a text (including mathematical or other formulas) and/or a graphical element (diagram, figure, image...) as substitutable forms, which, according to a condition test, may or may not appear in the generated document. One of the most common forms of conditional content management is multilingual ; but it can also include versioning, confidentiality levels, and so on. The philosophy of this package is based on the respective notions of condition field, condition property and condition space. With this package, any substitutable form in a source document is identified by a condition field and a condition property. The condition field is a functional theme that allows you to group together substitutable forms for the same conditional management. The condition property is a functional characterization specific to each substitutable form of a single condition domain. The condition space is used to designate the substitutable form(s) that must appear in the generated document. A condition space is defined by specifying a condition domain and a condition property to match with one or more substitutable forms."

The class provides a set of commands to create rubrics, entries in these rubrics etc. CurVe then format the CV (possibly splitting it onto multiple pages, repeating the titles etc), which is usually the most painful part of CV writing. Another nice feature of CurVe is its ability to manage different CV 'flavours' simultaneously. It is often the case that you want to maintain slightly divergent versions of your CV at the same time, in order to emphasize on different aspects of your background. CurVe also comes with support for use with AUC-TeX."

#. tumbleweed/texlive-specs-f/texlive-cyklop/description
msgid "The Cyclop typeface was designed in the 1920s at the workshop of Warsaw type foundry \"Odlewnia Czcionek J. Idzkowski i S-ka\". This sans serif typeface has a highly modulated stroke so it has high typographic contrast. The vertical stems are much heavier then horizontal ones. Most characters have thin rectangles as additional counters giving the unique shape of the characters. The lead types of Cyclop typeface were produced in slanted variant at sizes 8-48 pt. It was heavily used for heads in newspapers and accidents prints. Typesetters used Cyclop in the inter-war period, during the occupation in the underground press. The typeface was used until the beginnings of the offset print and computer typesetting era. Nowadays it is hard to find the metal types of this typeface. The font was generated using the Metatype1 package. Then the original set of characters was completed by adding the full set of accented letters and characters of the modern Latin alphabets (including Vietnamese). The upright variant was generated and it was more complicated task than it appeared at the beginning. 11 upright letters of the Cyclop typeface were presented in the book by Filip Trzaska, \"Podstawy techniki wydawniczej\" (\"Foundation of the publishing techonology\"), Warsaw 1967. But even the author of the book does not know what was the source of the presented examples. The fonts are distributed in the Type1 and OpenType formats along with the files necessary for use these fonts in TeX and LaTeX including encoding definition files: T1 (ec), T5 (Vietnamese), OT4, QX, texnansi and nonstandard ones (IL2 for Czech fonts)."

This package ensures consistency in the tables (i.e. fontsize), and is thus a better alternative to inserting tables via images. The decision-table package adds the \\dmntable command, with which tables can be created. This command expands into a tabular, so it can be used within a table or figure environment. Furthermore, this allows labels and captions to be added seamlessly. It is also possible to place multiple DMN tables in one table/figure environment. The package relies on nicematrix and l3keys2e."

It includes a macro by David Kastrup for converting positive whole numbers to dozenal from decimal (base ten) representation. The package also includes a few other macros and redefines all the standard counters to produce dozenal output. Fonts, in Roman, italic, slanted, and boldface versions, provide ten and eleven (the Pitman characters preferred by the Dozenal Society of Great Britain). The fonts were designed to blend well with the Computer Modern fonts, and are available both as Metafont source and in Adobe Type 1 format."

Recent releases of LaTeX2e support the EC fonts. The EC fonts supersede the preliminary version released as the DC fonts. The fonts are available in (traced) Adobe Type 1 format, as part of the cm-super bundle.

Using the language of mathematics and logic, the researchers communicated these new results to others in their community via published papers, research talks, etc. Unfortunately, they found the symbols already available for reasoning about relations lacking (in contrast to sets, which have a long-ago developed and robust symbol vocabulary). Early presentations were unnecessarily cluttered. To more elegantly express these ideas around relations, Cook recruited artist Tauba Auerbach to help develop a set of symbols.

This allows code to be hacked in ways the original authors might have never envisioned. The gates package is implemented independently for both TeX and Lua.

Particle resonances may also have a resonance specifier which is typeset in parentheses following the main symbol. In general the parentheses may also be followed by sub- and superscripts. 4. The particle names are expected to be used both in and out of mathematical contexts. 5. If the surrounding text is bold or italic then the particle name should adapt to that context as best as possible (this may not be possible for Greek symbols).

Now, with the hyperxmp package, it is trivial for LaTeX document authors to store XMP metadata in their documents as well. The package integrates seamlessly with hyperref and requires virtually no modifications to documents that already exploit hyperref's mechanisms for specifying PDF metadata. The current version of hyperxmp can embed the following metadata as XMP: title, authors, primary author's title or position, metadata writer, subject/summary, keywords, copyright, license URL, document base URL, document identifier and instance identifier, language, source file name, PDF generating tool, PDF version, and contact telephone number/postal address/email address/URL.

First, you can describe the workflows either in an external file llmk.toml or in a LaTeX document source in the form of magic comments. Further, multiple magic comment formats can be used. Second, it is fully cross-platform. The only requirement of the program is the texlua command; llmk provides a uniform way to describe the workflows available for nearly all TeX environments. Third, it behaves exactly the same in any environment. At this point, llmk intentionally does not provide any method for user configuration.

Compiler scripts and integrated LaTeX editing environments may parse this file to determine the next steps in the workflow in a way that is more efficient than parsing the main log file. In sum, the package will do two things: enable package authors to use LaTeX commands to issue requests, collect all requests from all packages and write them to an external XML file at the end of the document."

The aim is that such a task could be accomplished by someone with only a very basic training in TeX programming. Thus, Lollipop aims to make structured text formatting available in environments where typical users would switch to WYSIWYG packages for the freedom that such a mechanism offers. In addition, development of support for Lollipop documents written in RTL languages (such as Persian) is underway."

Repeating decimals is handled correctly, putting a bar over the repeated part of the decimal. Dividends up to 20 digits long are handled gracefully (though the typeset result will take up about a page), and dividends between 20 and 60 digits long slightly less gracefully. The package defines two macros, \\longdivision and \\intlongdivision. Each takes two arguments, a dividend and a divisor. \\longdivision keeps dividing until the remainder is zero, or it encounters a repeated remainder. \\intlongdivision stops when the dividend stops (though the dividend doesn't have to be an integer).

Metaplot also includes a very flexible set of macros for generating plot axes, which may be useful in other contexts as well. Presently, MetaPlot is in something of a pre-release beta state; it is quite functional, but the syntax of the commands is still potentially in flux."

There is no package designed to configure its use with any font other than Minion Pro, but (for example) simply loading mnsymbol after mathpazo will probably do what is needed."

Manju is another language of North East Asia, belonging to the Tungusic branch of the Altaic languages. Though it is hardly spoken nowadays, it survives in written form as Manju was the native language of the rulers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) in China. Large quantities of documents of the Imperial Archives survive, as well as some of the finest dictionaries ever compiled in Asia, like the Pentaglot, a dictionary comprising Manju, Tibetan, Mongolian, Uighur and Chinese. MonTeX provides all necessary characters for writing standard Mongolian in Cyrillic and Classical (aka Traditional or Uighur) writing, and Manju as well as transliterated Tibetan texts, for which purpose a number of additional characters was created. In MonTeX, both Mongolian and Manju are entered in romanized form. The retransliteration (from Latin input to Mongolian and Manju output) is completely realized in TeX/Metafont so that no external preprocessor is required. Please note that most of the enhanced functions of MonTeX require a working e-LaTeX environment. This is especially true when compiling documents with Mongolian or Manju as the main document language. It is recommended to choose pdfelatex as the resulting PDF files are truly portable. Vertical text generated by MonTeX is not supported in DVI."

The package uses its own specialised fonts, which must be available on the system for musixtex to run. This version of MusiXTeX builds upon work by Andreas Egler, whose own version is no longer being developed.

In general, the effect of \\TransformNotes{input}{output} is that notes commands in the source will expect their arguments to match the input pattern, but the notes will be typeset according to the output pattern. An example is extracting single-instrument parts from a multi-instrument score. fixmsxpart corrects note spacing in a single-part MusiXTeX source (possibly derived from a multi-instrument score and as a result having irregular note spacing). msxlint detects incorrectly formatted notes lines in a MusiXTeX source file.

Its purpose is to typeset books following classical design and layout principles, with the express intention of encouraging the making of beautiful books by anyone with access to a good printer and with an inclination towards venerable crafts, e.g., bookbinding. The octavo class differs from the book class by implementing many of the proposals and insights of respected experts, especially Jan Tschichold and Hugh Williamson. The documentation discusses methods to organise and print out any text into signatures, which can then be gathered, folded and sewn into a book."

Capitals are extra short, and only very slightly heavier than the lowercase characters. This helps achieve a more even typographical colour when typesetting proper nouns and initialisms."

To our knowledge, the repertoire of characters covers all European languages as well as some other Latin-based alphabets such as Vietnamese and Navajo; at the request of users, recent extensions (following the enhancement of the Latin Modern collection) provide glyphs sufficient for typesetting of romanized transliterations of Arabic and Sanskrit scripts. The Antykwa Poltawskiego family consists of 4 weights (light, normal, medium, bold), each having upright and italic forms and one of 5 design sizes: 6, 8, 10, 12 and 17pt. Altogether, the collection comprises 40 font files, containing the same repertoire of 1126 characters.

#. tumbleweed/texlive-specs-s/texlive-proofread/description
msgid "This package defines a few LaTeX commands that may be useful when you proofread a LaTeX document. They allow you to easily highlight text and add comments in the margin. Vim escape sequences are provided for inserting or removing these LaTeX commands in the source. Options are provided for displaying the document with extra line spacing, and for displaying it in either corrected or uncorrected state, both without margin notes. The package is based on code for a text highlighting command that was published by Antal Spector-Zabusky on http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/5959. The main file, proofread.dtx, is self-extracting, so you can generate the style file by compiling proofread.dtx with pdfLaTeX. This package is based on the soul package; so if you plan to highlight non-ASCII characters, you must compile your source with either XeTeX- or LuaTeX-based compilers."

#. tumbleweed/texlive-specs-s/texlive-prooftrees/description
msgid "The package supports drawing proof trees of the kind often used in introductory logic classes, especially those aimed at students without strong mathemtical backgrounds. Hodges (1991) is one example of a text which uses this system. When teaching such a system it is especially useful to annotate the tree with line numbers, justifications and explanations of branch closures. prooftrees provides a single environment, prooftree, and a variety of tools for annotating, customising and highlighting such trees. A cross-referencing system is provided for trees which cite line numbers in justifications for proof lines or branch closures. prooftrees is based on forest and, hence, TikZ. The package requires version 2.0.2 of Forest for expected results and will not work with version 1."

A correct Bounding Box is calculated for the EPS files and some PostScript command sequences that can produce errorneous results on printers are filtered. The input is cropped to include just the image contained in the PostScript file. The EPS files can then be included into TeX documents. Other programs like ps2epsi (a script distributed with ghostscript) don't always calculate the correct bounding box (because the values are put on the PostScript stack which may get corrupted by bad PostScript code) or they round it off, resulting in clipping the image. Therefore ps2eps uses a resolution of 144 dpi to get the correct bounding box. The bundle includes binaries for Linux, Solaris, Digital Unix or Windows 2000/9x/NT; for other platforms, the user needs perl, ghostscript and an ANSI-C compiler. Included in the distribution is the bbox program, an application to produce Bounding Box values for rawppm or rawpbm format files."

These are picture objects superimposed on the included graphic. A similar mechanism is implemented in psfrag itself (but deprecated in the documentation), but psfragx offers much more flexibility. For example, if babel is used, it is possible to define different replacements corresponding to different languages.

#. tumbleweed/texlive-specs-s/texlive-pslatex/description

You must have installed standard LaTeX and the psnfss PostScript fonts to use this package. The main novel feature is that the pslatex package tries to compensate for the visual differences between the Adobe fonts by scaling Helvetica by 90%, and 'condensing' Courier (i.e. scaling horizontally) by 85%. The package is supplied with a (unix) shell file for a 'pslatex' command that allows standard LaTeX documents to be processed, without needing to edit the file. Note that current psnfss uses a different technique for scaling Helvetica, and treats Courier as a lost cause (there are better free fixed-width available now, than there were when pslatex was designed). As a result, pslatex is widely considered obsolete."

Note that while many of the fonts are available in PostScript (and other) printers, most publishers require fonts embedded in documents, which requires that you have the fonts in your TeX system. Fortunately, there are free versions of the fonts from URW (available in the URW base5 bundle). The base set of text fonts covered by PSNFSS are: AvantGarde, Bookman, Courier, Helvetica, New Century Schoolbook, Palatino, Symbol, Times Roman and Zapf Dingbats. In addition, the fonts Bitstream Charter and Adobe Utopia are covered (those fonts were contributed to the Public Domain by their commercial foundries). Separate packages are provided to load each font for use as main text font. The packages helvet (which allows Helvetica to be loaded with its size scaled to something more nearly appropriate for its use as a Sans-Serif font to match Times) and pifont (which provides the means to select single glyphs from symbol fonts) are tailored to special requirements of their fonts. Mathematics are covered by the mathptmx package, which constructs passable mathematics from a combination of Times Roman, Symbol and some glyphs from Computer Modern, and by Pazo Math (optionally extended with the fpl small-caps and old-style figures fonts) which uses Palatino as base font, with the mathpazo fonts.

Its initial application is the production of PDF files for all major WEB programs for \"TeX and friends\" as distributed in TeX Live. For this purpose, the shell script makeall was whipped together; it provides various commandline options and works around several \"quirks\" in the WEB sources.

This function will assist users who want to use the japanese-otf package together with tailored TFMs of Japanese fonts. The \"jodel\" part of the package name stands for \"japanese-otf deluxe\". Here \"deluxe\" is the name of japanese-otf's option for employing multi-weight Japanese font families. This option is probably the most likely reason for using japanese-otf.

As a whole, this bundle allows users to dispense with the mapping setup on non-Unicode JFMs. Such a setup is useful in particular when users want to use OpenType fonts (such as Source Han Serif) that have a glyph encoding different from Adobe-Japan1, because mapping setups from non-Unicode JFMs to such physical fonts are difficult to prepare."

For example, one may want to print a large image on a spread, putting a half on a verso page, and another half on the next recto page. For this one would need a viewport occupying exactly one half of the file's bounding box, whatever the actual width of the image may be. This package adds a new keyword rviewport to the graphicx package specifiying Relative Viewport for graphics inclusion: a window defined by the given fractions of the natural width and height of the image."

The system uses keyval syntax, and the user can define their own keys and customize the system down to the last detail. At the same time, care has been taken to make the syntax as simple, natural, practical, and lightweight as possible. Furthermore, the package has a companion package, called stripsemantex, which allows you to completely strip your documents of SemanTeX markup to prepare them e.g. for publication. The package is still in beta, but is considered feature-complete and more or less stable, so using it at this point should be safe. Still, suggestions, ideas, and bug reports are more than welcome!"

msgid "Typesetting values with units requires care to ensure that the combined mathematical meaning of the value plus unit combination is clear. In particular, the SI units system lays down a consistent set of units with rules on how they are to be used. However, different countries and publishers have differing conventions on the exact appearance of numbers (and units). A number of LaTeX packages have been developed to provide consistent application of the various rules: SIunits, sistyle, unitsdef and units are the leading examples. The numprint package provides a large number of number-related functions, while dcolumn and rccol provide tools for typesetting tabular numbers. The siunitx package takes the best from the existing packages, and adds new features and a consistent interface. A number of new ideas have been incorporated, to fill gaps in the existing provision. The package also provides backward-compatibility with SIunits, sistyle, unitsdef and units. The aim is to have one package to handle all of the possible unit-related needs of LaTeX users. The package relies on LaTeX 3 support from the l3kernel and l3packages bundles."

It can also compute and draw a bar diagram in case of individual values, or, when the data repartition is known from ranges, an histogram or the continuous cumulative distribution function. You can ask 'statistics' to display no result, selective results or all of them. Similarly 'statistics' can draw only some parts of the graphs. Every part of the generated tables or graphics is customizable."

TeX Gyre Heros is based on URW Nimbus Sans L (from Helvetica, prepared by Max Miedinger, with Eduard Hoffmann in 1957). TeX Gyre Pagella is based on URW Palladio L (from Palatino, designed by Hermann Zapf in the 1940s). TeX Gyre Schola is based on the URW Century Schoolbook L family (from Century Schoolbook, designed by Morris Fuller Benton for the American Type Founders). TeX Gyre Termes is based on the URW Nimbus Roman No9 L family of fonts (from Times New Roman, designed by Stanley Morison together with Starling Burgess and Victor Lardent and first offered by Monotype). The constituent standard faces of each family have been greatly extended (though Chorus omits Greek support and has no small-caps family). Each family is available in Adobe Type 1 and Open Type formats, and LaTeX support (for use with a variety of encodings) is provided. Vietnamese characters were added by Han The Thanh.

msgid "Xdoc is a project to rewrite the implementation of the LaTeX doc package (in a broader sense) to make its features more general and flexible. For example, where doc only provides commands for documenting macros and environments, xdoc also provides commands for similarly documenting package options and switches. This is furthermore done in such a way that it is very easy to add more such commands for documenting things, such as e.g., templates (an important concept in the future LaTeX3) and program components for other languages (functions, classes, procedures, etc.). A side effect is that many minor bugs in doc are fixed. The design aims to take advantage of many still experimental features of future versions of LaTeX, but since these are neither reasonably stable nor widely available, the configuration interfaces and package author commands of xdoc are likely to change. To still provide a stable interface for other packages to build upon, the actual package names include a \"major version number\" of sorts. The drop-in replacement package for standard doc is xdoc2; it requires nothing outside standard LaTeX2e. The docindex/docidx2e package changes the index and list of changes typesetting so that none of the formatting has to be controlled via the index style file. The docindex package provides control of formatting via templates (nice interface, but requires several experimental packages), whereas the docidx2e package has traditional raw macro interfaces and works with standard LaTeX2e."

It is essential that each of these three elements is constructed independent of the other two, and hence they can be modified without unwanted side effects. The macros are based on the xy-pic package."

msgid "XyMTeX is a set of packages for drawing a wide variety of chemical structural formulas in a way that reflects their structure. The package provides three output modes: 'LaTeX', 'PostScript' and 'PDF'. XyMTeX's commands have a systematic set of arguments for specifying substituents and their positions, endocyclic double bonds, and bond patterns. In some cases there are additional arguments for specifying hetero-atoms on the vertices of heterocycles. It is believed that this systematic design allows XyMTeX to operate as a practical (device-independent) tool for use with LaTeX."

It has also been designed to (optionally) take advantage of powerful tools available in LaTeX, including packages: BibLaTeX for the bibliography; glossaries for the glossary, list of acronyms and symbols list. The yathesis class, based on the book class, aims to be both simple to use and, to some extent, (easily) customizable. yathesis comes with templates and samples in the doc/latex/yathesis/french/exemples/ directory in the distribution. They can also be tested on ShareLaTeX (template and specimen) and on Overleaf (template and specimen). Note: The \"ya\" in the package name stands for \"yet another\"."

Values assigned to attributes can be retrieved and tested in various ways, with full expandability ensured as much as possible. Finally, YaX's syntax is a quite peculiar (as few braces as possible), but may be customized. YaX is based on texapi and thus requires e-TeX."
