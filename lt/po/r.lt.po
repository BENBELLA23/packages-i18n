"Relax-and-Recover (abbreviated rear) is the leading Free Software disaster "
"recovery framework.\n"
"\n"
"Relax-and-Recover is written entirely in the native language for system "
"administration: as bash scripts.\n"
"\n"
"Experienced users and system admins can adapt or extend the rear scripts to "
"make it work for their particular cases.\n"
"\n"
"Relax-and-Recover is a modular framework with ready-to-go workflows for "
"common situations.\n"
"\n"
"The basic workflow is as follows: Specify its configuration in /etc/rear/"
"local.conf (cf. /usr/share/rear/conf/examples) and run \"rear mkbackup\" to "
"create a backup.tar.gz on a NFS server and a bootable recovery ISO image for "
"your system. A recovery medium which is made from the ISO image boots a "
"special rear recovery system. Log in as root and run \"rear recover\" which "
"does the following steps: It runs the rear installer that recreates the "
"basic system, in particular the system disk partitioning with filesystems "
"and mount points, then it restores the backup from the NFS server and "
"finally it installs the boot loader. Finally remove the recovery medium and "
"reboot the recreated system.\n"
"\n"
"Relax-and-Recover supports various kind of boot media for the recovery "
"system (incl. ISO, PXE, OBDR tape, USB or eSATA storage), a variety of "
"network protocols (incl. sftp, ftp, http, nfs, cifs) for storage and backup "
"as well as various external third-party backup methods (incl. IBM Tivoli "
"Storage Manager, HP DataProtector, Symantec NetBackup, EMC NetWorker, FDR/"
"Upstream, NovaBACKUP DC, Bareos, Bacula, rsync, rbme).\n"
"\n"
"Warning for users who like to upgrade Relax-and-Recover: Users who already "
"use it must re-validate that their particular disaster recovery procedure "
"still works.\n"
"\n"
"Additionally when you already use Relax-and-Recover and you upgrade software "
"that is related to the basic system (e.g. kernel, storage, bootloader, init, "
"networking) or you do other changes in your basic system, you must also re-"
"validate that your particular disaster recovery procedure still works for "
"you.\n"
"\n"
"You must test in advance that it works in your particular case to recreate "
"your particular system with your particular recovery medium and that the "
"recreated system can boot on its own and that the recreated system with all "
"its system services still work as you need it in your particular case.\n"
"\n"
"You must have replacement hardware available on which your system can be "
"recreated and you must try out if it works to recreate your system with your "
"recovery medium on your replacement hardware.\n"
"\n"
"Be prepared that your system recovery fails to recreate your system. When it "
"fails to recreate your system it is usually a dead end. Be prepared for a "
"manual recreation from scratch. Always have all information available that "
"you need to recreate your particular system manually. Manually recreate your "
"system on your replacement hardware as an exercise.\n"

"Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, "

"languages are not good at: embedding in other languages, programs with "
"specific space and time requirements, and writing low-level code, like "
"device drivers and operating systems. It improves on current languages "
"targeting this space by having a number of compile-time safety checks that "
"produce no runtime overhead, while eliminating all data races. Rust also "
"aims to achieve \"zero-cost abstractions\", even though some of these "
