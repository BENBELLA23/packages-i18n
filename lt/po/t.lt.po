"Typo3 FLOW is a web application platform enabling developers creating excell "
"ent web solutions and bring back the joy of coding.\n"
"\n"
"It gives you fast results. It is a reliable foundation for complex "
"applications. And it is backed by one of the biggest PHP communities.\n"
"\n"
"Typo3 FLOW is not a pick'n'mix store of motley components. It's a framework "
"which helps you with the infrastructure of your application. Object "
"Lifecycle Management, Package Management, Resource Management and Security "
"are on it's home field. Real business logic is left to custom packages.\n"
"\n"
"Whenever possible, Typo3 FLOW analyzes your code for choosing the right "
"configuration for you. Clear conventions and an intuitive API let you "
"concentrate on the essential parts of your application. After all you want "
"to write PHP and not XML, YAML, INI, don't you?\n"
"\n"
"Well-proven concepts from various frameworks, applications and programming "
"languages were considered for the design of Typo3 FLOW. Techniques like "
"Dependency Injection and Aspect-Oriented Programming open up new ways of "
"developing PHP applications. But instead of just copying other solutions, "
"the concepts have been carefully adapted to fit the \"Typo3 FLOW feeling\".\n"
"\n"
"Typo3 FLOW was created as the foundation of the next generation Typo3 CMS "
"called Typo3 neos. Applications based on Typo3 FLOW can be used as a plugin "
"in TYPO3 or serve as standalone solutions, completely independent from the "
"CMS. By using FLOW3 as an application platform, you get a CMS on top!"
