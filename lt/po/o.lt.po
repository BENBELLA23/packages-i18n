msgid ""
"Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate a "
"new object of a particular class. Java supports dynamic instantiation of "
"classes using Class.newInstance(); however, this only works if the class has "
"an appropriate constructor. There are many times when a class cannot be "
"instantiated this way, such as when the class contains constructors that "
"require arguments, that have side effects, and/or that throw exceptions. As "
"a result, it is common to see restrictions in libraries stating that classes "
"must require a default constructor. Objenesis aims to overcome these "
"restrictions by bypassing the constructor on object instantiation. Needing "
"to instantiate an object without calling the constructor is a fairly "
"specialized task, however there are certain cases when this is useful:\n"
"* Serialization, Remoting and Persistence - Objects need to be "
"instantiated   and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.\n"
"* Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects - Classes can be sub-classed "
"without   needing to worry about the super() constructor.\n"
"* Container Frameworks - Objects can be dynamically instantiated in   non-"
"standard ways."

"OpenConnect server (ocserv) is an SSL VPN server. Its purpose is to be a "
"secure, small, fast and configurable VPN server. It implements the "
"OpenConnect SSL VPN protocol, and has also (currently experimental) "
"compatibility with clients using the AnyConnect SSL VPN protocol. The "
"OpenConnect protocol provides a dual TCP/UDP VPN channel, and uses the "
"standard IETF security protocols to secure it. The server is implemented "
"primarily for the GNU/Linux platform but its code is designed to be portable "
"to other UNIX variants as well.\n"
"\n"
"Ocserv's main features are security through privilege separation and "
"sandboxing, accounting, and resilience due to a combined use of TCP and UDP. "
"Authentication occurs in an isolated security module process, and each user "
"is assigned an unprivileged worker process, and a networking (tun) device. "
"That not only eases the control of the resources of each user or group of "
"users, but also prevents data leak (e.g., heartbleed-style attacks), and "
"privilege escalation due to any bug on the VPN handling (worker) process. A "
"management interface allows for viewing and querying logged-in users."

"OpenMW is a new and modern engine based on the one that runs the 2002 open-"
"world RPG Morrowind. The engine (OpenMW) will come with its own editor "
"(OpenCS) which will allow the user to edit or create their own games. Both "
"OpenCS and OpenMW are written from scratch and aren’t made to support any "
"third party programs the original Morrowind engine uses to improve its "
"functionality. To give you a better idea of what this project is about, here "
"are some of the aims for the future of the OpenMW engine:\n"
"\n"
"  * Be a full-featured reimplementation of the Morrowind engine.   * Run "
"natively on Windows, Linux and MacOS X.   * Support all existing content, "
"including Tribunal, Bloodmoon and all user created mods (in case they "
"don’t      use external programs).   * Allow much greater modability: change "
"game rules, create new spell effects, etc. through scripting.   * Fix system "
"design bugs, like save-game “doubling” problem.   * Improve the interface "
"and journal system.   * Improved graphics by taking advantage of more modern "
"hardware.   * Support to improve game mechanics, physics, combat and AI.   * "
"(Possibly) Support to implement multiplayer   * (Possibly) Support to run on "
"mobile devices.\n"
"\n"
"NOTE(!!!): Playing Morrowind with this engine STILL REQUIRES one to own the "
"Morrowind data files.\n"
"\n"
"OpenCS will support the editing of all OpenMW features. We aim for the "
"editor to stay fully up-to-date with the corresponding OpenMW version, "
"allowing the user to edit any newly implemented features. Post v1.0 features "
"are going to be the use of OpenCS as a debugging tool for OpenMW content and "
"the support for editor plugins. These are files that add to the editor code, "
"improving its functionality to allow it to have some nice extras. The OpenCS "
"is not based on the editing tool which came with the original Morrowind "
"game, it is a program made by modders for modders. Important properties of "
"the OpenCS are:\n"
"\n"
" * non-blocking  * multi-threaded  * multi-document support  * multi-view "
"support  * high scalability  * customisable GUI"

"Reputation Web-based Malware Detection - identifies malicious web content by "
