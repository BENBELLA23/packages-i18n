"PhysicsFS is a library to provide abstract access to various archives. It is "
"intended for use in video games, and the design was somewhat inspired by "
"Quake 3's file subsystem. The programmer defines a \"write directory\" on "
"the physical filesystem. No file writing done through the PhysicsFS API can "
"leave that write directory, for security. For example, an embedded scripting "
"language cannot write outside of this path if it uses PhysFS for all of its "
"I/O, which means that untrusted scripts can run more safely. Symbolic links "
"can be disabled as well, for added safety. For file reading, the programmer "
"lists directories and archives that form a \"search path\". Once the search "
"path is defined, it becomes a single, transparent hierarchical filesystem. "
"This makes for easy access to ZIP files in the same way as you access a file "
"directly on the disk, and it makes it easy to ship a new archive that will "
"override a previous archive on a per-file basis. Finally, PhysicsFS gives "
"you platform-abstracted means to determine if CD-ROMs are available, the "
"user's home directory, where in the real filesystem your program is running, "
"etc."

"of writers, which convert this native representation into a target format. "
"Thus, adding an input or output format requires only adding a reader or "

"Pen is a load balancer for \"simple\" tcp based protocols such as http or "
"smtp. It allows several servers to appear as one to the outside and "
"automatically detects servers that are down and distributes clients among "
"the available servers. This gives high availability and scalable "
"performance.\n"
"\n"
"The load balancing algorithm keeps track of clients and will try to send "
"them back to the server they visited the last time. This is useful for "
"applications that maintain state between connections in the server, "
"including most modern web applications.\n"
"\n"
"When pen detects that a server is unavailable, it scans for another starting "
"with the server after the most recently used one. That way we get load "
"balancing and \"fair\" failover for free.\n"
"\n"
"Correctly configured, pen can ensure that a server farm is always available, "
"even when individual servers are brought down for maintenance or "
"reconfiguration.\n"
"\n"
"The final single point of failure, pen itself, can be eliminated by running "
"pen on several servers, using vrrp to decide which is active.\n"
