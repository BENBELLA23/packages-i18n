"\n"
"The micro-benchmark is composed of 10 phases that perform various generic "

"are optimized for a specific architecture. The micro-benchmark is easily "
"extensible, provides performance counter readings (today) and energy "

"allows the user to run each phase in different configurations/\n"
"\n"
"One of the main benefits of this tool is that it is scalable beyond the "
"aforementioned investigations, and is useful for anyone who would like to "
"understand system behaviour, whilst running small, simple and well-"
"understood computational kernels. The level of flexibility built into the "
"application is an added benefit, as it gives the user full control of what "
"is being run, where it is run, and whether it's single or multi-threaded, "

"in the console, and another in the X terminal emulator, no need to switch "

"cause gaps between files, because the next file to be played is precached "
