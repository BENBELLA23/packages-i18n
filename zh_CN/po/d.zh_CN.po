"DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs.  Its purpose is to "

"1. DejaGnu provides a layer of abstraction that allows you to write    tests "

"For instance, a test for GDB can run (from any    Unix-based host) on any "
"target architecture that DejaGnu    supports.\n"
"\n"
"1. All tests have the same output format.  This makes it easy to    "
"integrate testing into other software development processes.    DejaGnu's "

"Starting with version 1.0.2, DOSEMU configuration files are no longer in /"
