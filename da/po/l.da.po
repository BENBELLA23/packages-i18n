"LHAPDF provides a unified and easy to use interface to modern PDF sets. It "
"is designed to work not only with individual PDF sets but also with the more "
"recent multiple \"error\" sets. It can be viewed as the successor to PDFLIB, "
"incorporating many of the older sets found in the latter, including pion and "
"photon PDFs. In LHAPDF the computer code and input parameters/grids are "
"separated thus allowing more easy updating and no limit to the expansion "
"possibilities. The code and data sets can be downloaded together or "
"inidivually as desired. From version 4.1 onwards a configuration script "
"facilitates the installation of LHAPDF.\n"

"\n"
"LinuxSampler was designed as a sampler backend, decoupled from any user "

"we planned to add existing ones as well (e.g. OSC). With the planned SMP and "
"cluster support LinuxSampler might become a standard for high-end studios "
"and concerts.\n"

"\n"
"LV2 is both a stable interface and a forward-moving project: there is a "
"stable set of \"official\" extensions in use while new functionality is "
"actively developed. Anyone can extend LV2, which allows developers to try "
"out new ideas and ensure they work in practice. Good extensions are vetted "
"by the community and included in the official distribution so they can be "
"relied on to be widely supported. This open development model means "
"developers can always scratch their itch without a central authority getting "
"in the way. The current stable release includes most functionality required "
"by modern plugins, including:\n"
"\n"
"  * Audio, control, \"control voltage\" (audio-rate control), and event     "
"(e.g. MIDI) input and output   * Expressive open-ended port metadata, "
"including:     - \"Meaningful\" controls (e.g. gain or envelope attack) "

"(e.g. Hz, octaves, dB)     - Multi-channel port groups (e.g. stereo, 5.1 "
"surround, ambisonics   * Embeddable GUIs in any toolkit, with support for a "
"full plugin/UI split     (including network transparency in capable hosts)   "
"* Ability to bundle any files (e.g. samples or impulses) with plugins   * "
"Presets (bundled and/or user saved)   * Plugin state saving and restoring   "
"* Host-managed logging   * Non-realtime plugin worker methods (simple and "
"portable host-managed     threading)   * Message-based plugin communication, "
"allowing plugins/UIs to have advanced     interfaces without host support or "
"specifications getting in the way   * Transport awareness, both real time "
"and tempo time (bars, beats, etc-.)\n"

"LV2 has graceful compatibility \"baked in\": for example, a simple amplifier "
"plugin might have audio in/out with a gain control, and function in any "
"host. The same plugin could have a fancy GUI and transport awareness which "
"optionally work in hosts that support these features. Conversely, hosts know "
"not to load plugins that require features it does not support.\n"
"\n"
"See the specification index for complete documentation. If you are a host or "
"plugin author and need missing functionality, please file a ticket or let us "
"know your requirements on  the mailing list. LV2 is a community project that "
