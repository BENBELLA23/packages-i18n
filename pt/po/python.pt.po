"outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have to think about encodings, "

msgid ""
"It often happens that you have text data in Unicode, but you need to "
"represent it in ASCII. For example when integrating with legacy code that "
"doesn't support Unicode, or for ease of entry of non-Roman names on a US "
"keyboard, or when constructing ASCII machine identifiers from human-readable "
"Unicode strings that should still be somewhat intelligible (a popular "
"example of this is when making an URL slug from an article title).\n"
"\n"
"In most of these examples you could represent Unicode characters as \"???\" "
"or \"\\\\15BA\\\\15A0\\\\1610\", to mention two extreme cases. But that's "
"nearly useless to someone who actually wants to read what the text says.\n"
"\n"
"What Unidecode provides is a middle road: function unidecode() takes Unicode "
"data and tries to represent it in ASCII characters (i.e., the universally "
"displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F), where the compromises taken "
"when mapping between two character sets are chosen to be near what a human "
"with a US keyboard would choose.\n"
"\n"
"The quality of resulting ASCII representation varies. For languages of "
"western origin it should be between perfect and good. On the other hand "
"transliteration (i.e., conveying, in Roman letters, the pronunciation "
"expressed by the text in some other writing system) of languages like "
"Chinese, Japanese or Korean is a very complex issue and this library does "
"not even attempt to address it. It draws the line at context-free character-"
"by-character mapping. So a good rule of thumb is that the further the script "
"you are transliterating is from Latin alphabet, the worse the "
"transliteration will be.\n"
"\n"
"Note that this module generally produces better results than simply "
"stripping accents from characters (which can be done in Python with built-in "
"functions). It is based on hand-tuned character mappings that for example "
"also contain ASCII approximations for symbols and non-Latin alphabets.\n"

"astor is designed to allow easy manipulation of Python source via the AST. "
"There are some other similar libraries, but astor focuses on the following "

"- Round-trip an AST back to Python:   - Modified AST doesn't need "
"linenumbers, ctx, etc. or otherwise     be directly compileable for the "
"round-trip to work.   - Easy to read generated code as, well, code   - Can "
"round-trip two different source trees to compare for functional     "
"differences, using the astor.rtrip tool (for example, after PEP8 edits).\n"
"- Dump pretty-printing of AST   - Harder to read than round-tripped code, "
"but more accurate to figure out what     is going on.   - Easier to read "
"than dump from built-in AST module\n"
"- Non-recursive treewalk   - Sometimes you want a recursive treewalk (and "
"astor supports that, starting     at any node on the tree), but sometimes "
"you don't need to do that.  astor     doesn't require you to explicitly "
"visit sub-nodes unless you want to:   - You can add code that executes "
"before a node's children are visited, and/or   - You can add code that "
"executes after a node's children are visited, and/or   - You can add code "
"that executes and keeps the node's children from being     visited (and "
"optionally visit them yourself via a recursive call)   - Write functions to "
"access the tree based on object names and/or attribute names   - Enjoy easy "
"access to parent node(s) for tree rewriting"

"*Blessed* is a more simplified wrapper around curses, providing : \n"
"* Styles, color, and maybe a little positioning without necessarily   "
"clearing the whole screen first.\n"
"* Works great with standard Python string formatting.\n"
"* Provides up-to-the-moment terminal height and width, so you can respond "
"to   terminal size changes.\n"
"* Avoids making a mess if the output gets piped to a non-terminal:   outputs "
"to any file-like object such as *StringIO*, files, or pipes.\n"
"* Uses the `terminfo(5)`_ database so it works with any terminal type   and "
"supports any terminal capability: No more C-like calls to tigetstr_   and "
"tparm_.\n"
"* Keeps a minimum of internal state, so you can feel free to mix and match "
"with   calls to curses or whatever other terminal libraries you like.\n"
"* Provides plenty of context managers to safely express terminal modes,   "
"automatically restoring the terminal to a safe state on exit.\n"
"* Act intelligently when somebody redirects your output to a file, "
"omitting   all of the terminal sequences such as styling, colors, or "
"positioning.\n"
"* Dead-simple keyboard handling: safely decoding unicode input in your   "
"system's preferred locale and supports application/arrow keys.\n"
"* Allows the printable length of strings containing sequences to be   "
"determined.\n"
"\n"
"Blessed **does not** provide... \n"
"* Windows command prompt support.  A PDCurses_ build of python for windows   "
"provides only partial support at this time -- there are plans to merge "
"with   the ansi module in concert with colorama to resolve this."

"Scspell does not try to be particularly smart--rather, it does the simplest "
"thing that can possibly work:\n"
"\n"
"    1. All alphanumeric strings (strings of letters, numbers, and        "
"underscores) are spell-checked tokens.     2. Each token is split into one "
"or more subtokens. Underscores and digits        always divide tokens, and "
"capital letters will begin new subtokens. In        other words, "
"``some_variable`` and ``someVariable`` will both generate        the "
"subtoken list {``some``, ``variable``}.     3. All subtokens longer than "
"three characters are matched against a set of        dictionaries, and a "
"match failure prompts the user for action. When        matching against the "
"included English dictionary, *prefix matching* is        employed; this "
"choice permits the use of truncated words like ``dict``        as valid "
"subtokens.\n"
"\n"
"When applied to code written in most popular programming languages while "
"using typical naming conventions, this algorithm will usually catch many "
"errors without an annoying false positive rate.\n"
"\n"
"In an effort to catch more spelling errors, Scspell is able to check each "
"file against a set of dictionary words selected *specifically for that "
"file*. Up to three different sub-dictionaries may be searched for any given "
"file:\n"
"\n"
"    1. A natural language dictionary. (Scspell provides an American        "
"English dictionary as the default.)     2. A programming language-specific "
"dictionary, intended to contain        oddly-spelled keywords and APIs "
"associated with that language.        (Scspell provides small default "
"dictionaries for a number of popular        programming languages.)     3. A "
"file-specific dictionary, intended to contain uncommon strings which        "
"are not likely to be found in more than a handful of unique files."

" * Clean and lightweight API offers a short learning curve and    long-term "

"MySQL.  * Storm is easy to debug, since its code is written with a KISS    "
"principle, and thus is easy to understand.  * Designed from day one to work "
"both at the low end, with trivial    small databases, and the high end, with "

"The aim of the **wrapt** module is to provide a transparent object proxy for "
"Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function "

"\n"
"The **wrapt** module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes way "
"beyond existing mechanisms such as ``functools.wraps()`` to ensure that "
"decorators preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities "
"etc. The decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in "
"far more scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and "
"consistent behaviour.\n"

"To ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module "

"django-pglocks provides a useful context manager to manage PostgreSQL "

"(probably) psycopg2.\n"
"\n"
"Advisory locks are application-level locks that are acquired and released "
"purely by the client of the database; PostgreSQL never acquires them on its "
"own. They are very useful as a way of signalling to other sessions that a "
"higher-level resource than a single row is in use, without having to lock an "
"entire table or some other structure.\n"
"\n"
"It's entirely up to the application to correctly acquire the right lock.\n"

"Advisory locks are either session locks or transaction locks. A session lock "
"is held until the database session disconnects (or is reset); a transaction "
"lock is held until the transaction terminates.\n"

"Currently, the context manager only creates session locks, as the behavior "
"of a lock persisting after the context body has been exited is surprising, "
