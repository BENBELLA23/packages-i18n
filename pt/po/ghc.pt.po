msgid ""
"Do you ever feel the need to test code involving bottoms (e.g. calls to the "
"'error' function), or code involving infinite values? Then this library "
"could be useful for you.\n"
"\n"
"It is usually easy to get a grip on bottoms by showing a value and waiting "
"to see how much gets printed before the first exception is encountered. "
"However, that quickly gets tiresome and is hard to automate using e.g. "
"QuickCheck (<http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/>). With this "
"library you can do the tests as simply as the following examples show.\n"
"\n"
"Testing explicitly for bottoms:\n"
"\n"
"> > isBottom (head []) > True\n"
"\n"
"> > isBottom bottom > True\n"
"\n"
"> > isBottom (_ -> bottom) > False\n"
"\n"
"> > isBottom (bottom, bottom) > False\n"
"\n"
"Comparing finite, partial values:\n"
"\n"
"> > ((bottom, 3) :: (Bool, Int)) ==! (bottom, 2+5-4) > True\n"
"\n"
"> > ((bottom, bottom) :: (Bool, Int)) <! (bottom, 8) > True\n"
"\n"
"Showing partial and infinite values ('\\/!' is join and '/\\!' is meet):\n"
"\n"
"> > approxShow 4 $ (True, bottom) /! (bottom, 'b') > \"Just (True, 'b')\"\n"
"\n"
"> > approxShow 4 $ (True, bottom) /! (bottom, 'b') > \"(_|_, _|_)\"\n"
"\n"
"> > approxShow 4 $ ([1..] :: [Int]) > \"[1, 2, 3, _\"\n"
"\n"
"> > approxShow 4 $ (cycle [bottom] :: [Bool]) > \"[_|_, _|_, _|_, _\"\n"
"\n"
"Approximately comparing infinite, partial values:\n"
"\n"
"> > approx 100 [2,4..] ==! approx 100 (filter even [1..] :: [Int]) > True\n"
"\n"
"> > approx 100 [2,4..] /=! approx 100 (filter even [bottom..] :: [Int]) > "
"True\n"
"\n"
"The code above relies on the fact that 'bottom', just as 'error \"...\"', "
"'undefined' and pattern match failures, yield exceptions. Sometimes we are "
"dealing with properly non-terminating computations, such as the following "
"example, and then it can be nice to be able to apply a time-out:\n"
"\n"
"> > timeOut' 1 (reverse [1..5]) > Value [5,4,3,2,1]\n"
"\n"
"> > timeOut' 1 (reverse [1..]) > NonTermination\n"
"\n"
"The time-out functionality can be used to treat \"slow\" computations as "
"bottoms:\n"
"\n"
"' > let tweak = Tweak &#x7b; approxDepth = Just 5, timeOutLimit = Just 2 "
"&#x7d; > semanticEq tweak (reverse [1..], [1..]) (bottom :: [Int], [1..] :: "
"[Int]) True '\n"
"\n"
"' > let tweak = noTweak &#x7b; timeOutLimit = Just 2 &#x7d; > semanticJoin "
"tweak (reverse [1..], True) ([] :: [Int], bottom) Just ([],True) '\n"
"\n"
"This can of course be dangerous:\n"
"\n"
"' > let tweak = noTweak &#x7b; timeOutLimit = Just 0 &#x7d; > semanticEq "
"tweak (reverse [1..100000000]) (bottom :: [Integer]) True '\n"
"\n"
"Timeouts can also be applied to 'IO' computations:\n"
"\n"
"> > let primes () = unfoldr ((x:xs) -> Just (x, filter ((/= 0) . (`mod` x)) "
"xs)) [2..] > > timeOutMicro 100 (print $ primes ()) > [2,NonTermination > > "
"timeOutMicro 10000 (print $ take 10 $ primes ()) > "
"[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29] > Value ()\n"
"\n"
"For the underlying theory and a larger example involving use of QuickCheck, "
"see the article \"Chasing Bottoms, A Case Study in Program Verification in "
"the Presence of Partial and Infinite Values\" (<http://www.cse.chalmers.se/"
"~nad/publications/danielsson-jansson-mpc2004.html>).\n"
"\n"
"The code has been tested using GHC. Most parts can probably be ported to "
"other Haskell compilers, but this would require some work. The 'TimeOut' "
"functions require preemptive scheduling, and most of the rest requires 'Data."
"Generics'; 'isBottom' only requires exceptions, though."

"The HTTP package supports client-side web programming in Haskell. It lets "
"you set up HTTP connections, transmitting requests and processing the "
"responses coming back, all from within the comforts of Haskell. It's "
"dependent on the network package to operate, but other than that, the "
"implementation is all written in Haskell.\n"
"\n"
"A basic API for issuing single HTTP requests + receiving responses is "
"provided. On top of that, a session-level abstraction is also on offer (the "
"'BrowserAction' monad); it taking care of handling the management of "
"persistent connections, proxies, state (cookies) and authentication "
"credentials required to handle multi-step interactions with a web server.\n"
"\n"
"The representation of the bytes flowing across is extensible via the use of "
"a type class, letting you pick the representation of requests and responses "
"that best fits your use. Some pre-packaged, common instances are provided "
"for you ('ByteString', 'String').\n"
"\n"
"Here's an example use:\n"
"\n"
"> > do > rsp <- Network.HTTP.simpleHTTP (getRequest \"http://www.haskell.org/"
"\") > -- fetch document and return it (as a 'String'.) > fmap (take 100) "
"(getResponseBody rsp) > > do > (_, rsp) > <- Network.Browser.browse $ do > "
"setAllowRedirects True -- handle HTTP redirects > request $ getRequest "
"\"http://www.haskell.org/\" > return (take 100 (rspBody rsp))\n"

"MFlow is a web framework that turns the mess of web programming from "
"handlers and configuration files back into sane and normal programming. Your "
"code is the website.\n"
"\n"
"The goals of MFlow are. ~~~ -Inverting back the inversion of control of web "
"applications and turn web programming into ordinary, intuitive, imperative-"
"like programming. \n"
"-At the same time, maintaining for the programmer all the freedom that they "
"have in web applications. MFlow keeps out of your way. \n"
"-For scalability-sensitive applications, no fat state snapshots that other "
"continuation-based frameworks need to cope with these two previous "
"requirements. State replication and horizontal scalability are central to "
"MFlow's philosophy. \n"
"-For REST advocates, MFlow maintains the elegant notation of REST URLs and "
"the statelessness of GET requests. \n"
"-For expert Haskell programmers, reuse of already existing web libraries and "
"techniques is trivial. \n"
"-For beginner programmers and for software engineers, MFlow provides a high "
"level DSL of reusable and self contained widgets for the user interface, and "
"multipage procedures that work together provided that they statically "
"typecheck with zero configuration. \n"
"-For highly interactive applications, MFlow gives dynamic widgets that have "
"their own behaviors in the page and they communicate without the need of "
"explicit JavaScript programming. \n"
"-No deployment, speed up the development process. see <http://haskell-web."
"blogspot.com.es/2013/05/a-web-application-in-tweet.html>\n"
"\n"
"How navigation works ~~~ MFlow solves the problem of re-inversion of control "
"by using a different approach, routes are expressed as normal monadic "
"Haskell code in the FlowM monad, local links point to alternative routes "
"within this monadic computation, this means any GET page is directly "
"reachable by means of a RESTful URL.\n"
"\n"
"At any moment the flow can respond to the back button or to any RESTful path "
"that the user may paste in the navigation bar. If the procedure is waiting "
"for another different page, the FlowM monad backtrack until the paths "
"partially match. From this position on the execution goes forward until the "
"rest of the paths match. Thus, no matter the previous state of the server "
"process it will recover the state of execution appropriate for the request. "
"This way the server process is virtually stateless for any GET request. It "
"is also possible to store a session state, which may backtrack or not, when "
"the navigation goes back and forth. MFlow keeps it all in sync, "
"synchronization between server state and web browser state is supported out-"
"of-the-box.\n"
"\n"
"When the state matters, and user interactions can last for long period of "
"time, such are shopping carts etc., MFlow uses a log for thread state "
"persistence. The server process shuts itself down after a programmer defined "
"timeout, once a new request of the same user arrives, the log is used to "
"recover the process state. There is no need to store a snapshot of every "
"continuation, just the result of each step. This solves the problem of fat "
"state snapshots and give a very lightweight way to handle state.\n"
"\n"
"Data tier ~~~ State consistency and transactions are handled by the TCache "
"package.\n"
"\n"
"www.hackage.haskell.org/package/TCache\n"
"\n"
"It is data cache within the STM monad (Software Transactional Memory), "
"serialization and deserialization of data is programmer defined. TCache can "
"adapt to any database, default persistence in files comes out of the box for "
"rapid development purposes, but you can switch to a variety of backends when "
"needed, see the database examples for more details.\n"
"\n"
"Widgets ~~~ The processes interact through widgets, which are an extension "
"of formlets with additional applicative combinators, formatting, link "
"management, callbacks, modifiers, caching, and AJAX. All of it is coded in "
"pure Haskell and you use pure Haskell to make your own widgets. Each widget "
"return statically typed data, they can dynamically modify themselves using "
"AJAX internally (just prefix it with auto refresh), are auto-contained: they "
"may include their own JavaScript code, server code and client code in a "
"single pure Haskell procedure that can be combined with other widgets with "
"no other configuration.\n"
"\n"
"To combine widgets, applicative combinators are used. Widgets with dynamic "
"behaviors that use the monadic syntax and callbacks. When you combine "
"widgets, everything is type checked and making large websites by gluing "
"together small reusable building blocks is the entire aim of the MFlow "
"project.\n"
"\n"
"Modularity ~~~ The interfaces and communications are abstract and there are "
"bindings for blaze-HTML, HSP, Text.XHtml, ByteString, Hack, and WAI. So it "
"can be extended to non web based architectures.\n"
"\n"
"Bindings for hack, and HSP >= 0.8, are not installed by default, but are "
"included in the package files. To use them, add them to the exported modules "
"and execute cabal install\n"

"A library to deal with application settings.\n"
"\n"
"This library deals with read-write application settings. You will have to "
"specify the settings that your application uses, their name, types and "
"default values.\n"
"\n"
"Setting types must implement the 'Read' and 'Show' typeclasses.\n"
"\n"
"The settings are saved in a file in an INI-like key-value format (without "
"sections).\n"
"\n"
"Reading and updating settings is done in pure code, the IO monad is only "
"used to load settings and save them to disk. It is advised for the user to "
"create a module in your project holding settings handling.\n"
"\n"
"You can then declare settings:\n"
"\n"
"> fontSize :: Setting Double > fontSize = Setting \"fontSize\" 14 > > "
"dateFormat :: Setting String > dateFormat = Setting \"dateFormat\" \"%{x}\" "
"> > backgroundColor :: Setting (Int, Int, Int) > backgroundColor = Setting "
"\"backcolor\" (255, 0, 0)\n"
"\n"
"Optionally you can declare the list of all your settings, in that case the "
"application will also save the default values in the configuration file, but "
"commented out:\n"
"\n"
"> fontSize=16 > # dateFormat=\"%x\" > # backcolor=(255,0,0)\n"
"\n"
"If you do not specify the list of settings, only the first line would be "
"present in the configuration file.\n"
"\n"
"With an ordinary setting, one row in the configuration file means one "
"setting. That setting may of course be a list for instance. This setup works "
"very well for shorter lists like [1,2,3], however if you have a list of more "
"complex items, you will get very long lines and a configuration file very "
"difficult to edit by hand.\n"
"\n"
"For these special cases there is also the 'ListSetting' constructor:\n"
"\n"
"> testList :: Setting [String] > testList = ListSetting \"testList"
"\" [\"list1\", \"list2\", \"list3\"]\n"
"\n"
"Now the configuration file looks like that:\n"
"\n"
"> testList_1=\"list1\" > testList_2=\"list2\" > testList_3=\"list3\"\n"
"\n"
"Which is much more handy for big lists. An empty list is represented like "
"so:\n"
"\n"
"> testList=\n"
"\n"
"There is also another technique that you can use if you have too long lines: "
"you can put line breaks in the setting values if you start the following "
"lines with a leading space, like so:\n"
"\n"
"> testList=[\"list1\", > \"list2\", \"list3\"]\n"
"\n"
"In that case don't use the ListSetting option. Any character after the the "
"leading space in the next lines will go in the setting value. Note that the "
"library will automatically wrap setting values longer than 80 characters "
"when saving.\n"
"\n"
"Once we declared the settings, we can read the configuration from disk (and "
"your settings module should export your wrapper around the function offered "
"by this library):\n"
"\n"
"> readResult <- try $ readSettings (AutoFromAppName \"test\") > case "
"readResult of > Right (conf, GetSetting getSetting) -> do > let textSize = "
"getSetting fontSize > saveSettings emptyDefaultConfig (AutoFromAppName \"test"
"\") conf > Left (x :: SomeException) -> error \"Error reading the config "
"file!\"\n"
"\n"
"'AutoFromAppName' specifies where to save the configuration file. And we've "
"already covered the getSetting in this snippet, see the 'readSettings' "
"documentation for further information.\n"
"\n"
"You can also look at the tests of the library on the github project for "
"sample use."

"Read the README first! <https://github.com/mstksg/auto/blob/master/README."
"md> , for motivating examples, and concrete explanations of things described "
"here.\n"
"\n"
"/auto/ is a Haskell DSL and platform providing declarative, compositional, "
"denotative semantics for discrete-step, locally stateful, interactive "
"programs, games, and automations, with implicitly derived serialization. It "
"is suited for any domain where either the input or the output can be "
"described as a stream of values: a stream of input events, output views, "
"etc.\n"
"\n"
"/auto/ works by providing a type that encapsulates \"value stream "
"transformers\", or locally stateful functions; by specifying your program as "
"a (potentially cyclic) graph of relationships between value streams, you "
"create a way of \"declaring\" a system based simply on static relationships "
"between quantities.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of a \"state monad\" type solution, where all functions have access "
"to a rigid global state, /auto/ works by specifying relationships which each "
"exist independently and on their own, without any global state.\n"
"\n"
"A more fuller exposition is in the `README.md`, in this project directory "
"and also online at <https://github.com/mstksg/auto/blob/master/README.md>; "
"you can get started by reading the tutorial, which is also in this project "
"directory in the `tutorial` directory, and also incidentally online at "
"<https://github.com/mstksg/auto/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.md>. Also, "
"check out the <https://github.com/mstksg/auto-examples auto-examples> "
"repository on github for plenty of real-world and toy examples to learn "
"from; I've also done a <http://blog.jle.im/entries/series/+all-about-auto "
"blog series> on this library, with examples and full tutorials!\n"
"\n"

"the github issue tracker for the source repository.\n"

"__Introduction__\n"
"\n"
"This package provides varieties of binary search functions. c.f. \"Numeric."
"Search\" for the examples.\n"
"\n"
"These search function can search for pure and monadic predicates, of type:\n"
"\n"
"> pred :: Eq b => a -> b > pred :: (Eq b, Monad m) => a -> m b\n"
"\n"
"The predicates must satisfy that the domain range for any codomain value is "
"continuous; that is, '?x?y?z. pred x == pred z ? pred y == pred x' .\n"
"\n"
"For example, we can address the problem of finding the boundary of an upward-"
"closed set of integers, using a combination of exponential and binary "
"searches.\n"
"\n"
"Variants are provided for searching within bounded and unbounded intervals "
"of both 'Integer' and bounded integral types.\n"
"\n"
"The package was created by Ross Paterson, and extended by Takayuki "
"Muranushi, to be used together with SMT solvers.\n"
"\n"
"__The Module Structure__ \n"
"* \"Numeric.Search\" provides the generic search combinator, to search for "
"pure and monadic predicates. * \"Numeric.Search.Bounded\" , \"Numeric.Search."
"Integer\" , \"Numeric.Search.Range\" provides the various specialized "
"searchers, which means less number of function arguments, and easier to "
"use.\n"

"In Haskell 98 the name of a record field is automatically also the name of a "
"function which gets the value of the according field. E.g. if we have\n"
"\n"
"data Pair a b = Pair first :: a, second :: b\n"
"\n"
"then\n"
"\n"
"> first :: Pair a b -> a > second :: Pair a b -> b\n"
"\n"
"However for setting or modifying a field value we need to use some syntactic "
"sugar, which is often clumsy.\n"
"\n"
"modifyFirst :: (a -> a) -> (Pair a b -> Pair a b) modifyFirst f r@(Pair "
"first=a ) = r first = f a\n"
"\n"
"With this package you can define record field accessors which allow setting, "
"getting and modifying values easily. The package clearly demonstrates the "
"power of the functional approach: You can combine accessors of a record and "
"sub-records, to make the access look like the fields of the sub-record "
"belong to the main record.\n"
"\n"
"Example:\n"
"\n"
"> *Data.Accessor.Example> (first^:second^=10) (('b',7),\"hallo\") > "
"(('b',10),\"hallo\")\n"
"\n"
"You can easily manipulate record fields in a 'Control.Monad.State.State' "
"monad, you can easily code 'Show' instances that use the Accessor syntax and "
"you can parse binary streams into records. See 'Data.Accessor.Example' for "
"demonstration of all features.\n"
"\n"
"It would be great if in revised Haskell versions the names of record fields "
"are automatically 'Data.Accessor.Accessor's rather than plain 'get' "
"functions. For now, the package 'data-accessor-template' provides Template "
"Haskell functions for automated generation of 'Data.Acesssor.Accessor's. See "
"also the other 'data-accessor' packages that provide an Accessor interface "
"to other data types. The package 'enumset' provides accessors to bit-packed "
"records.\n"
"\n"
"For similar packages see 'lenses' and 'fclabel'. A related concept are "
"editors <http://conal.net/blog/posts/semantic-editor-combinators/>. Editors "
"only consist of a modify method (and 'modify' applied to a 'const' function "
"is a 'set' function). This way, they can modify all function values of a "
"function at once, whereas an accessor can only change a single function "
"value, say, it can change 'f 0 = 1' to 'f 0 = 2'. This way, editors can even "
"change the type of a record or a function. An Arrow instance can be defined "
"for editors, but for accessors only a Category instance is possible ('(.)' "
"method). The reason is the 'arr' method of the 'Arrow' class, that conflicts "
"with the two-way nature (set and get) of accessors."

"'data-reify' provided the ability to turn recursive structures into explicit "
"graphs. Many (implicitly or explicitly) recursive data structure can be "
"given this ability, via a type class instance. This gives an alternative to "
"using 'Ref' for observable sharing.\n"
"\n"
"Observable sharing in general is unsafe, so we use the IO monad to bound "
"this effect, but can be used safely even with 'unsafePerformIO' if some "
"simple conditions are met. Typically this package will be used to tie the "
"knot with DSL's that depend of observable sharing, like Lava.\n"
"\n"
"Providing an instance for 'MuRef' is the mechanism for allowing a structure "
"to be reified into a graph, and several examples of this are provided.\n"
"\n"
"History: Version 0.1 used unsafe pointer compares. Version 0.2 of 'data-"
"reify' used 'StableName's, and was much faster. Version 0.3 provided two "
"versions of 'MuRef', the mono-typed version, for trees of a single type, and "
"the dynamic-typed version, for trees of different types. Version 0.4 used "
"'Int' as a synonym for 'Unique' rather than 'Data.Unique' for node ids, by "
"popular demand. Version 0.5 merged the mono-typed and dynamic version again, "
"by using 'DynStableName', an unphantomized version of StableName.\n"

"ED-E is a templating language written in Haskell with a specific set of "
"features: \n"
"* Logicless within reason. A small set of consistent predicates and "
"expressions for formatting and presentational logic are provided. \n"
"* Secure. No arbitrary code evaluation, with input data required to be fully "
"specified at render time. \n"
"* Stateless. Parsing and rendering are separate steps so that loading, "
"parsing, include resolution, and embedding of the compiled template can "
"optionally be done ahead of time, amortising cost. \n"
"* Markup agnostic. ED-E is used to write out everything from configuration "
"files for system services, to HTML and formatted emails. \n"
"* Control over purity. Users can choose pure or IO-based resolution of "
"'include' expressions. \n"
"* No surprises. All parsing, type assurances, and rendering steps report "
"helpful error messages with line/column metadata. Variable shadowing, "
"unprintable expressions, implicit type coercion, and unbound variable access "
"are all treated as errors."

msgid ""
"This package provides a couple of different implementations of mutable hash "
"tables in the ST monad, as well as a typeclass abstracting their common "
"operations, and a set of wrappers to use the hash tables in the IO monad.\n"
"\n"
"/QUICK START/: documentation for the hash table operations is provided in "
"the \"Data.HashTable.Class\" module, and the IO wrappers (which most users "
"will probably prefer) are located in the \"Data.HashTable.IO\" module.\n"
"\n"
"This package currently contains three hash table implementations:\n"
"\n"
"1. \"Data.HashTable.ST.Cuckoo\" contains an implementation of \"cuckoo "
"hashing\" as introduced by Pagh and Rodler in 2001 (see <http://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/Cuckoo_hashing>). Cuckoo hashing has worst-case /O(1)/ lookups and "
"can reach a high \"load factor\", in which the table can perform acceptably "
"well even when approaching 90% full. Randomized testing shows this "
"implementation of cuckoo hashing to be slightly faster on insert and "
"slightly slower on lookup than \"Data.Hashtable.ST.Basic\", while being more "
"space efficient by about a half-word per key-value mapping. Cuckoo hashing, "
"like the basic hash table implementation using linear probing, can suffer "
"from long delays when the table is resized.\n"
"\n"
"2. \"Data.HashTable.ST.Basic\" contains a basic open-addressing hash table "
"using linear probing as the collision strategy. On a pure speed basis it "
"should currently be the fastest available Haskell hash table implementation "
"for lookups, although it has a higher memory overhead than the other tables "
"and can suffer from long delays when the table is resized because all of the "
"elements in the table need to be rehashed.\n"
"\n"
"3. \"Data.HashTable.ST.Linear\" contains a linear hash table (see <http://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_hashing>), which trades some insert and lookup "
"performance for higher space efficiency and much shorter delays when "
"expanding the table. In most cases, benchmarks show this table to be "
"currently slightly faster than 'Data.HashTable' from the Haskell base "
"library.\n"
"\n"
"It is recommended to create a concrete type alias in your code when using "
"this package, i.e.:\n"
"\n"
"> import qualified Data.HashTable.IO as H > > type HashTable k v = H."
"BasicHashTable k v > > foo :: IO (HashTable Int Int) > foo = do > ht <- H."
"new > H.insert ht 1 1 > return ht\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, this makes it easy to switch to a different hash table "
"implementation, and secondly, using a concrete type rather than leaving your "
"functions abstract in the HashTable class should allow GHC to optimize away "
"the typeclass dictionaries.\n"
"\n"
"This package accepts a couple of different cabal flags: \n"
"* 'unsafe-tricks', default /ON/. If this flag is enabled, we use some unsafe "
"GHC-specific tricks to save indirections (namely 'unsafeCoerce#' and "
"'reallyUnsafePtrEquality#'. These techniques rely on assumptions about the "
"behaviour of the GHC runtime system and, although they've been tested and "
"should be safe under normal conditions, are slightly dangerous. Caveat "
"emptor. In particular, these techniques are incompatible with HPC code "
"coverage reports. \n"
"* 'sse42', default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, we use some SSE 4.2 "
"instructions (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4>, first available on "
"Intel Core 2 processors) to speed up cache-line searches for cuckoo "
"hashing. \n"
"* 'bounds-checking', default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, array accesses "
"are bounds-checked. \n"
"* 'debug', default /OFF/. If turned on, we'll rudely spew debug output to "
"stdout. \n"
"* 'portable', default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, we use only pure "
"Haskell code and try not to use unportable GHC extensions. Turning this flag "
"on forces 'unsafe-tricks' and 'sse42' /OFF/.\n"

"Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to "
"as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, "
"sets and sorted sets. This library is a Haskell client for the Redis "
"datastore. Compared to other Haskell client libraries it has some "
"advantages:\n"
"\n"
"[Compatibility with Latest Stable Redis:] Hedis is intended to be used with "
"the latest stable version of Redis (currently 3.2). Most redis commands "
"(<http://redis.io/commands>) are available as haskell functions, although "
"MONITOR and SYNC are intentionally omitted. Additionally, a low-level API is "
"exposed that makes it easy for the library user to implement further "
"commands, such as new commands from an experimental Redis version.\n"
"\n"
"[Automatic Optimal Pipelining:] Commands are pipelined (<http://redis.io/"
"topics/pipelining>) as much as possible without any work by the user. See "
"<http://informatikr.com/2012/redis-pipelining.html> for a technical "
"explanation of automatic optimal pipelining.\n"
"\n"
"[Enforced Pub/Sub semantics:] When subscribed to the Redis Pub/Sub server "
"(<http://redis.io/topics/pubsub>), clients are not allowed to issue commands "
"other than subscribing to or unsubscribing from channels. This library uses "
"the type system to enforce the correct behavior.\n"
"\n"
"[Connect via TCP or Unix Domain Socket:] TCP sockets are the default way to "
"connect to a Redis server. For connections to a server on the same machine, "
"Unix domain sockets offer higher performance than the standard TCP "
"connection.\n"
"\n"

"This Haskell package provides a data structure of sets that are indexed by "

"Sets can be created, modified, and queried in various ways.\n"

"The package is a variant of the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ixset "

"find a suitable index on a query, resulting in possible run-time errors when "

"At the moment, the two packages are relatively compatible. As a consequence "
"of the more precise types, a few manual tweaks are necessary when switching "

"package, the original van Laarhoven-O'Connor lens library. 'lens-family' is "
"particularly remarkable for its minute number of dependencies: (apart from "
"<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl mtl> they are all ghc 'boot' "

"theoretical soundness. Much of the material it contains is well-explained, "

"tutorial lens-tutorial> It is independent, self-standing and readily "
"intelligible apart from any darker more general system of combinators that "
"might attempt to extend it. Much of it ought to be in the Prelude.\n"
"\n"
"Convenient import of the elementary combinators from 'lens-family', however, "
"a little complicated. The idea of this trivial module, then, is just to make "

"precisely by saying nothing - requires only this abbreviating change of "
"imports.\n"
"\n"
"If you make that program more complicated, you might of course end up "
"needing the more sophisticated material in 'Control.Lens' and its immense "
"mass of dependencies. On the other hand, you might just need some of the "
"additional material present in the similarly demystifying <http://hackage."

"This library is an extract from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens "

"* You want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but don't "

"* You just want to be able to use lenses to transform data (or even just use "
"'over _1' to change the first element of a tuple). \n"
"* You are new to lenses and want a small library to play with.\n"
"\n"
"However, don't use this library if: \n"
"* You need 'Iso's, 'Prism's, indexed traversals, or actually anything else "
"which isn't defined here (tho some indexed functions are available "
"elsewhere ? containers and vector provide them for their types, and <http://"
"hackage.haskell.org/package/ilist ilist> provides indexed functions for "
"lists). \n"
"* You want a library with a clean, understandable implementation (in which "
"case you're looking for <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-simple lens-"
"simple>).\n"
"\n"
"As already mentioned, if you're writing an application which uses lenses "
"more extensively, look at <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-"

"hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-ghc microlens-ghc>).\n"

"\"Network.Transport\" is a Network Abstraction Layer which provides the "
"following high-level concepts: \n"
"* Nodes in the network are represented by 'EndPoint's. These are heavyweight "
"stateful objects. \n"
"* Each 'EndPoint' has an 'EndPointAddress'. \n"
"* Connections can be established from one 'EndPoint' to another using the "
"'EndPointAddress' of the remote end. \n"
"* The 'EndPointAddress' can be serialised and sent over the network, where "
"as 'EndPoint's and connections cannot. \n"
"* Connections between 'EndPoint's are unidirectional and lightweight. \n"
"* Outgoing messages are sent via a 'Connection' object that represents the "
"sending end of the connection. \n"
"* Incoming messages for /all/ of the incoming connections on an 'EndPoint' "
"are collected via a shared receive queue. \n"
"* In addition to incoming messages, 'EndPoint's are notified of other "
"'Event's such as new connections or broken connections.\n"
"\n"
"This design was heavily influenced by the design of the Common Communication "
"Interface (<http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/common-communication-"
"interface>). Important design goals are: \n"
"* Connections should be lightweight: it should be no problem to create "
"thousands of connections between endpoints. \n"
"* Error handling is explicit: every function declares as part of its type "
"which errors it can return (no exceptions are thrown) \n"
"* Error handling is \"abstract\": errors that originate from implementation "
"specific problems (such as \"no more sockets\" in the TCP implementation) "
"get mapped to generic errors (\"insufficient resources\") at the Transport "
"level.\n"

"Let's start with the first. When you create a memoizable function, you "
"should use the 'self' convention, which is that the first input to the "
"function is 'self', and all recursive calls are replaced with 'self'. One "
"common convention that goes well with the 'self' convention is using a "
"helper function 'go', like so:\n"
"\n"
"' fib :: Memoizable (Integer -> Integer) fib self = go where go 0 = 1 go 1 = "
"1 go n = self (n-1) + self (n-2) '\n"
"\n"
"Now for the second. For this example, we need a Memoizer that can handle an "
"'Integer' input, and an 'Integer' output. 'Data.MemoCombinators' provides "
"'integral', which handles any 'Integral' input, and any output. 'Data."
"MemoUgly' provides 'memo', which can memoize any function 'a -> b', given an "
"'Ord' instance for 'a'.\n"
"\n"
"Third, let's run our memoizers! Since we have decoupled the definition of "
"the memoized function from its actual memoization, we can create multiple "
"memoized versions of the same function if we so desire.\n"
"\n"
"' import qualified Data.MemoUgly as Ugly import qualified Data."
"MemoCombinators as MC\n"
"\n"
"fibUgly :: Integer -> Integer fibUgly = runMemo Ugly.memo fib\n"
"\n"
"fibMC :: Integer -> Integer fibMC = runMemo MC.integral fib '\n"
"\n"
"You could easily do the same with 'Data.MemoTrie.memo', 'Data.Function."
"Memoize.memoize', etc.\n"
"\n"
"Using this technique, you can create local memoized functions whose memo "
"tables are garbage collected as soon as they are no longer needed."

"Provides a wide array of (semi)groupoids and operations for working with "

"\n"
"A 'Semigroupoid' is a 'Category' without the requirement of identity arrows "
"for every object in the category.\n"
"\n"
"A 'Category' is any 'Semigroupoid' for which the Yoneda lemma holds.\n"
"\n"
"When working with comonads you often have the '<*>' portion of an "
"'Applicative', but not the 'pure'. This was captured in Uustalu and Vene's "
"\"Essence of Dataflow Programming\" in the form of the 'ComonadZip' class in "
"the days before 'Applicative'. Apply provides a weaker invariant, but for "
"the comonads used for data flow programming (found in the streams package), "
"this invariant is preserved. Applicative function composition forms a "
"semigroupoid.\n"
"\n"
"Similarly many structures are nearly a comonad, but not quite, for instance "
"lists provide a reasonable 'extend' operation in the form of 'tails', but do "
"not always contain a value.\n"
"\n"
"Ideally the following relationships would hold:\n"
"\n"
"> Foldable ----> Traversable <--- Functor ------> Alt ---------> Plus "
"Semigroupoid > | | | | | > v v v v v > Foldable1 ---> Traversable1 Apply\n"
"--------> Applicative -> Alternative Category > | | | | > v v v v > Bind\n"
"---------> Monad -------> MonadPlus Arrow >\n"
"\n"
"Apply, Bind, and Extend (not shown) give rise the Static, Kleisli and "
"Cokleisli semigroupoids respectively.\n"
"\n"
"This lets us remove many of the restrictions from various monad transformers "
"as in many cases the binding operation or '<*>' operation does not require "
"them.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, to work with these weaker structures it is beneficial to have "
"containers that can provide stronger guarantees about their contents, so "
"versions of 'Traversable' and 'Foldable' that can be folded with just a "
"'Semigroup' are added."

msgid ""
"The 'set-monad' library exports the 'Set' abstract data type and set-"
"manipulating functions. These functions behave exactly as their namesakes "
"from the 'Data.Set' module of the 'containers' library. In addition, the "
"'set-monad' library extends 'Data.Set' by providing 'Functor', "
"'Applicative', 'Alternative', 'Foldable', 'Monad', and 'MonadPlus' instances "
"for sets.\n"
"\n"
"In other words, you can use the 'set-monad' library as a drop-in replacement "
"for the 'Data.Set' module of the 'containers' library and, in addition, you "
"will also get the aforementioned instances which are not available in the "
"'containers' package.\n"
"\n"
"It is not possible to directly implement instances for the aforementioned "
"standard Haskell type classes for the 'Set' data type from the 'containers' "
"library. This is because the key operations 'map' and 'union', are "
"constrained with 'Ord' as follows.\n"
"\n"
"> map :: (Ord a, Ord b) => (a -> b) -> Set a -> Set b > union :: (Ord a) => "
"Set a -> Set a -> Set a\n"
"\n"
"The 'set-monad' library provides the type class instances by wrapping the "
"constrained 'Set' type into a data type that has unconstrained constructors "
"corresponding to monadic combinators. The data type constructors that "
"represent monadic combinators are evaluated with a constrained run function. "
"This elevates the need to use the constraints in the instance definitions "
"(this is what prevents a direct definition). The wrapping and unwrapping "
"happens internally in the library and does not affect its interface.\n"
"\n"
"For details, see the rather compact definitions of the 'run' function and "
"type class instances. The left identity and associativity monad laws play a "
"crucial role in the definition of the 'run' function. The rest of the code "
"should be self explanatory.\n"
"\n"
"The technique is not new. This library was inspired by [1]. To my knowledge, "
"the original, systematic presentation of the idea to represent monadic "
"combinators as data is given in [2]. There is also a Haskell library that "
"provides a generic infrastructure for the aforementioned wrapping and "
"unwrapping [3].\n"
"\n"
"The 'set-monad' library is particularly useful for writing set-oriented code "
"using the do and/or monad comprehension notations. For example, the "
"following definitions now type check.\n"
"\n"
"> s1 :: Set (Int,Int) > s1 = do a <- fromList [1 .. 4] > b <- fromList [1 .. "
"4] > return (a,b)\n"
"\n"
"> -- with -XMonadComprehensions > s2 :: Set (Int,Int) > s2 = [ (a,b) | (a,b) "
"<- s1, even a, even b ]\n"
"\n"
"> s3 :: Set Int > s3 = fmap (+1) (fromList [1 .. 4])\n"
"\n"
"As noted in [1], the implementation technique can be used for monadic "
"libraries and EDSLs with restricted types (compiled EDSLs often restrict the "
"types that they can handle). Haskell's standard monad type class can be used "
"for restricted monad instances. There is no need to resort to GHC extensions "
"that rebind the standard monadic combinators with the library or EDSL "
"specific ones.\n"

"\n"
"This package provides speculative function application and speculative "
"folds. Speculative STM transactions take the place of the transactional "
"rollback machinery from the paper.\n"
"\n"
"For example:\n"
"\n"
"''spec' g f a' evaluates 'f g' while forcing 'a', if 'g == a' then 'f g' is "
"returned, otherwise 'f a' is evaluated and returned. Furthermore, if the "
"argument has already been evaluated, we skip the 'f g' computation entirely. "
"If a good guess at the value of 'a' is available, this is one way to induce "
"parallelism in an otherwise sequential task. However, if the guess isn't "
"available more cheaply than the actual answer, then this saves no work and "
"if the guess is wrong, you risk evaluating the function twice. Under high "
"load, since 'f g' is computed via the spark queue, the speculation will be "
"skipped and you will obtain the same answer as 'f $! a'.\n"
"\n"
"The best-case timeline looks like:\n"
"\n"
"> foreground: [----- a -----] > foreground: [-] (check g == a) > spark: "
"[----- f g -----] > overall: [--- spec g f a ---]\n"
"\n"
"The worst-case timeline looks like:\n"
"\n"
"> foreground: [----- a -----] > foreground: [-] (check g == a) > foreground: "
"[---- f a ----] > spark: [----- f g -----] > overall: [-------- spec g f a\n"
"---------]\n"
"\n"
"Note that, if 'f g' takes longer than a to compute, in the HEAD release of "
"GHC, 'f g' will be collected and killed during garbage collection.\n"
"\n"
"> foreground: [----- a -----] > foreground: [-] (check g == a) > foreground: "
"[---- f a ----] > spark: [---- f g ----###### (#'s mark when this spark is "
"collectable) > overall: [--------- spec g f a --------]\n"
"\n"
"Under high load:\n"
"\n"
"> foreground: [----- a -----] > foreground: [-] (check g == a) > foreground: "
"[---- f a ----] > overall: [-------- spec g f a ---------]\n"

"Compare these to the timeline of 'f $! a':\n"
"\n"
"> foreground: [----- a -----] > foreground: [---- f a ----] > orverall: "
"[---------- f $! a ---------]\n"
"\n"
"'specSTM' provides a similar time table for STM actions, but also rolls back "
"side-effects. The one unfortunate operational distinction is that it is "
"forced to compute 'a' in the background thread and therefore degrades "
"slightly less gracefully under load, although we mitigate this effect by "
"only enqueuing if the number of sparks for the current capability is lower "
"than the total number of capabilities, to try to avoid wasting time when all "
"computational resources are in use."

"With this package you can build a Storable instance of a record type from "
"Storable instances of its elements in an elegant way. It does not do any "
"magic, just a bit arithmetic to compute the right offsets, that would be "
"otherwise done manually or by a preprocessor like C2HS. I cannot promise "
"that the generated memory layout is compatible with that of a corresponding "
"C struct. However, the module generates the smallest layout that is possible "
"with respect to the alignment of the record elements. If you encounter, that "
"a record does not have a compatible layout, we should fix that. But also "
"without C compatibility this package is useful e.g. in connection with "
"StorableVector.\n"
"\n"
"We provide Storable instance support for several cases: \n"
"* If you wrap a type in a 'newtype', then you can lift its 'Storable' "

"This way you do not need the 'GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving' feature of GHC. \n"
"* If you have a type that is an instance of 'Traversable', you can use that "
"feature for implementation of 'Storable' methods. The module \"Foreign."
"Storable.Traversable\" allows manipulation of the portion of your type, that "
"is accessible by 'Traversable' methods. For instance with the type 'data T a "
"= Cons Int [a]' and an according 'Traversable' implementation, you can load "
"and store the elements of the contained list. This may be part of a "
"'Storable' implementation of the whole type. \n"
"* If you have a record containing elements of various types, then you need "
"module \"Foreign.Storable.Record\".\n"
"\n"
"Note however that the Storable instances defined with this package are quite "
"slow in (up to) GHC-6.12.1. I'm afraid this is due to incomplete inlining, "

"This package contains two modules, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/"
"streaming/docs/Streaming.html Streaming> and <http://hackage.haskell.org/"
"package/streaming/docs/Streaming-Prelude.html Streaming.Prelude>. The "
"principal module, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-0.1.4.3/docs/"
"Streaming-Prelude.html Streaming.Prelude>, exports an elementary streaming "
"prelude focused on a simple \"source\" or \"producer\" type, namely 'Stream "
"(Of a) m r'. This is a sort of effectful version of '([a],r)' in which "
"successive elements of type 'a' arise from some sort of monadic action "
"before the succession ends with a value of type 'r'. Everything in the "
"library is organized to make programming with this type as simple as "
"possible, by the simple expedient of making it as close to 'Prelude' and "
"'Data.List' as possible. Thus for example the trivial program\n"
"\n"
"> >>> S.sum $ S.take 3 (S.readLn :: Stream (Of Int) IO ()) > 1<Enter> > "
"2<Enter> > 3<Enter> > 6 :> ()\n"
"\n"
"sums the first three valid integers from user input. Similarly,\n"
"\n"
"> >>> S.stdoutLn $ S.map (map toUpper) $ S.take 2 S.stdinLn > hello<Enter> > "
"HELLO > world!<Enter> > WORLD!\n"
"\n"
"upper-cases the first two lines from stdin as they arise, and sends them to "
"stdout. And so on, with filtering, mapping, breaking, chunking, zipping, "
"unzipping, replicating and so forth: we program with streams of 'Int's or "
"'String's directly as if they constituted something like a list. That's "
"because streams really do constitute something like a list, and the "
"associated operations can mostly have the same names. (A few, like "
"'reverse', don't stream and thus disappear; others like 'unzip' are here "
"given properly streaming formulation for the first time.) And we everywhere "
"oppose \"extracting a pure list from IO\", which is the origin of typical "
"Haskell memory catastrophes. Basically any case where you are tempted to use "
"'mapM', 'replicateM', 'traverse' or 'sequence' with Haskell lists, you would "
"do better to use something like 'Stream (Of a) m r'. The type signatures are "
"a little fancier, but the programs themselves are mostly the same. /In fact, "
"they are mostly simpler./ Thus, consider the trivial demo program mentioned "
"in <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24068399/haskell-performance-of-"
"iorefs this SO question>\n"
"\n"
"> main = mapM newIORef [1..10^8::Int] >>= mapM readIORef >>= mapM_ print\n"
"\n"
"The new user notices that this exhausts memory, and worries about the "
"efficiency of Haskell 'IORefs'. But of course it exhausts memory! Look what "
"it says! The problem is immediately cured by writing\n"
"\n"
"> main = S.print $ S.mapM readIORef $ S.mapM newIORef $ S.each [1..10^8::"
"Int]\n"
"\n"
"which really does what the other program was meant to do, uses no more "
"memory than 'hello-world', /and is simpler anyway/, since it doesn't involve "
"the detour of \"extracting a list from IO\". Almost every use of list "
"'mapM', 'replicateM', 'traverse' and 'sequence' produces this problem on a "
"smaller scale. People get used to it, as if it were characteristic of "
"Haskell programs to use a lot of memory. But in truth \"extracting a list or "
"sequence from IO\" is mostly just bad practice pure and simple. Of course, "
"'mapM', 'replicateM', 'traverse' and 'sequence' make sense for lists, under "
"certain conditions! But 'unsafePerformIO' also makes sense under certain "
"conditions.\n"
"\n"
"The <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-0.1.4.3/docs/Streaming."
"html Streaming> module exports the general type, 'Stream f m r', which can "
"be used to stream successive distinct steps characterized by /any/ functor "
"'f', though we are mostly interested in organizing computations of the form "
"'Stream (Of a) m r'. The streaming-IO libraries have various devices for "
"dealing with effectful variants of '[a]' or '([a],r)' in which the emergence "
"of successive elements somehow depends on IO. But it is only with the "
"general type 'Stream f m r', or some equivalent, that one can envisage (for "
"example) the connected streaming of their sorts of stream - as one makes "
"lists of lists in the Haskell 'Prelude' and 'Data.List'. One needs some such "
"type if we are to express properly streaming equivalents of e.g.\n"
"\n"
"> group :: Ord a => [a] -> [[a]] > chunksOf :: Int -> [a] -> [[a]] > "
"lines :: [Char] -> [[Char]] -- but similarly with byte streams, etc.\n"
"\n"
"to mention a few obviously desirable operations. (This is explained more "
"elaborately in the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming#readme "
"readme> below.)\n"
"\n"
"One could throw of course throw something like the present 'Stream' type on "
"top of a prior stream concept: this is how 'pipes' and 'pipes-group' (which "
"are very much our model here) use 'FreeT'. But once one grasps the iterable "
"stream concept needed to express those functions then one will also see "
"that, with it, one is /already/ in possession of a complete elementary "
"streaming library - since one possesses 'Stream ((,) a) m r' or equivalently "
"'Stream (Of a) m r'. This is the type of a 'generator' or 'producer' or "
"'source' or whatever you call an effectful stream of items. /The present "
"Streaming.Prelude is thus the simplest streaming library that can replicate "
"anything like the API of the Prelude and Data.List/.\n"
"\n"
"The emphasis of the library is on interoperation; for the rest its "
"advantages are: extreme simplicity, re-use of intuitions the user has "
"gathered from mastery of 'Prelude' and 'Data.List', and a total and "
"systematic rejection of type synonyms. The two conceptual pre-requisites are "
"some comprehension of monad transformers and some familiarity with 'rank 2 "
"types'. It is hoped that experimentation with this simple material, starting "
"with the ghci examples in 'Streaming.Prelude', will give people who are new "
"to these concepts some intuition about their importance. The most "
"fundamental purpose of the library is to express elementary streaming ideas "
"without reliance on a complex framework, but in a way that integrates "
"transparently with the rest of Haskell, using ideas - e.g. rank 2 types, "
"which are here implicit or explicit in most mapping - that the user can "
"carry elsewhere, rather than chaining her understanding to the curiosities "
"of a so-called streaming IO framework (as necessary as that is for certain "
"purposes.)\n"
"\n"
"See the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming#readme readme> below "
"for further explanation, including the examples linked there. Elementary "
"usage can be divined from the ghci examples in 'Streaming.Prelude' and "
"perhaps from this rough beginning of a <https://github.com/michaelt/"
"streaming-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.md tutorial>. Note also the <https://"
"hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-bytestring streaming bytestring> and "
"<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-utils streaming utils> "
"packages. Questions about usage can be put raised on StackOverflow with the "
"tag '[haskell-streaming]', or as an issue on Github, or on the <https://"
"groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskell-pipes pipes list> (the package "
"understands itself as part of the pipes 'ecosystem'.)\n"
"\n"
"The simplest form of interoperation with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/"
"pipes pipes> is accomplished with this isomorphism:\n"
"\n"
"> Pipes.unfoldr Streaming.next :: Stream (Of a) m r -> Producer a m r > "
"Streaming.unfoldr Pipes.next :: Producer a m r -> Stream (Of a) m r\n"
"\n"
"Interoperation with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams io-"
"streams> is thus:\n"
"\n"
"> Streaming.reread IOStreams.read :: InputStream a -> Stream (Of a) IO () > "
"IOStreams.unfoldM Streaming.uncons :: Stream (Of a) IO () -> IO (InputStream "
"a)\n"
"\n"
"With <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit conduit> one might use, e."
"g.:\n"
"\n"
"> Conduit.unfoldM Streaming.uncons :: Stream (Of a) m () -> Source m a > str "
"-> Streaming.mapM_ Conduit.yield (hoist lift str) :: Stream (Of o) m r -> "
"ConduitM i o m r > src -> hoist lift str $$ Conduit.mapM_ Streaming.yield :: "
"Source m a\n"
"-> Stream (Of a) m ()\n"
"\n"
"These conversions should never be more expensive than a single '>->' or '="
"$='. The simplest interoperation with regular Haskell lists is provided by, "
"say\n"
"\n"
"> Streaming.each :: [a] -> Stream (Of a) m () > Streaming.toList_ :: Stream "
"(Of a) m r -> m [a]\n"
"\n"
"The latter of course accumulates the whole list in memory, and is mostly "
"what we are trying to avoid. Every use of 'Prelude.mapM f' should be "
"reconceived as using the composition 'Streaming.toList_ . Streaming.mapM f . "

"This is an implementation of effectful, memory-constrained bytestrings (byte "
"streams) and functions for streaming bytestring manipulation, adequate for "
"non-lazy-io.\n"
"\n"
"The implementation follows the details of 'Data.ByteString.Lazy' and 'Data."
"ByteString.Lazy.Char8' in unrelenting detail, omitting only transparently "
"non-streaming operations like 'reverse'. It is just a question of replacing "
"the lazy bytestring type:\n"
"\n"
"> data ByteString = Empty | Chunk Strict.ByteString ByteString\n"
"\n"
"with the /minimal/ effectful variant:\n"
"\n"
"> data ByteString m r = Empty r | Chunk Strict.ByteString (ByteString m r) | "
"Go (m (ByteString m r))\n"
"\n"
"(Constructors are necessarily hidden in internal modules in both the 'Lazy' "
"and the 'Streaming'.)\n"
"\n"
"That's it. As a lazy bytestring is implemented internally by a sort of list "
"of strict bytestring chunks, a streaming bytestring is simply implemented as "
"a /producer/ or /generator/ of strict bytestring chunks. Most operations are "
"defined by simply adding a line to what we find in 'Data.ByteString.Lazy'.\n"
"\n"
"Something like this alteration of type is of course obvious and mechanical, "
"once the idea of an effectful bytestring type is contemplated and lazy io is "
"rejected. Indeed it seems that this is the proper expression of what was "
"intended by lazy bytestrings to begin with. The documentation, after all, "
"reads \n"
"* \"A key feature of lazy ByteStrings is the means to manipulate large or "
"unbounded streams of data without requiring the entire sequence to be "
"resident in memory. To take advantage of this you have to write your "
"functions in a lazy streaming style, e.g. classic pipeline composition. The "
"default I/O chunk size is 32k, which should be good in most circumstances."
"\"\n"
"\n"
"... which is very much the idea of this library: the default chunk size for "
"'hGetContents' and the like follows 'Data.ByteString.Lazy'; operations like "
"'lines' and 'append' and so on are tailored not to increase chunk size.\n"
"\n"
"The present library is thus nothing but /lazy bytestring done right/. The "
"authors of 'Data.ByteString.Lazy' must have supposed that the directly "
"monadic formulation of such their type would necessarily make things slower. "
"This appears to be a prejudice. For example, passing a large file of short "
"lines through this benchmark transformation\n"
"\n"
"> Lazy.unlines . map (bs -> \"!\" <> Lazy.drop 5 bs) . Lazy.lines > "
"Streaming.unlines . S.maps (bs -> chunk \"!\" >> Streaming.drop 5 bs) . "
"Streaming.lines\n"
"\n"
"gives pleasing results like these\n"
"\n"
"> $ time ./benchlines lazy >> /dev/null > real 0m2.097s > ... > $ time ./"
"benchlines streaming >> /dev/null > real 0m1.930s\n"

"For a more sophisticated operation like\n"
"\n"
"> Lazy.intercalate \"!n\" . Lazy.lines > Streaming.intercalate \"!n\" . "

"\n"
"> time ./benchlines lazy >> /dev/null > real 0m1.250s > ... > time ./"
"benchlines streaming >> /dev/null > real 0m1.531s\n"
"\n"
"The pipes environment would express the latter as\n"
"\n"
"> Pipes.intercalates (Pipes.yield \"!n\") . view Pipes.lines\n"
"\n"
"meaning almost exactly what we mean above, but with results like this\n"
"\n"
"> time ./benchlines pipes >> /dev/null > real 0m6.353s\n"
"\n"
"The difference, however, is emphatically not intrinsic to pipes; it is just "
"that this library depends the 'streaming' library, which is used in place of "
"'free' to express the <http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/09/perfect-"
"streaming-using-pipes-bytestring.html \"perfectly streaming\"> splitting and "
"iterated division or \"chunking\" of byte streams.\n"
"\n"
"These concepts belong to the ABCs of streaming; 'lines' is just a textbook "
"example, and it is of course handled correctly in 'Data.ByteString.Lazy'. "
"But the concepts are /catastrophically mishandled/ in /all/ streaming io "
"libraries other than pipes. Already the 'enumerator' and 'iteratee' "
"libraries were completely defeated by 'lines': see e.g. the 'enumerator' "
"implementation of <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/enumerator-0.4.20/docs/"
"Data-Enumerator-Text.html#v:splitWhen splitWhen and lines>. This will "
"concatenate strict text forever, if that's what is coming in. The rot "
"spreads from there. It is just a fact that in all of the general streaming "
"io frameworks other than pipes,it becomes torture to express elementary "
"distinctions that are transparently and immediately contained in any idea of "
"streaming whatsoever.\n"
"\n"
"Though, as was said above, we barely alter signatures in 'Data.ByteString."
"Lazy' more than is required by the types, the point of view that emerges is "
"very much that of 'pipes-bytestring' and 'pipes-group'. In particular we "
"have these correspondences:\n"
"\n"
"> Lazy.splitAt :: Int -> ByteString -> (ByteString, ByteString) > Streaming."
"splitAt :: Int -> ByteString m r -> ByteString m (ByteString m r) > Pipes."
"splitAt :: Int -> Producer ByteString m r -> Producer ByteString m (Producer "
"ByteString m r)\n"
"\n"
"and\n"
"\n"
"> Lazy.lines :: ByteString -> [ByteString] > Streaming.lines :: ByteString m "
"r\n"
"-> Stream (ByteString m) m r > Pipes.lines :: Producer ByteString m r -> "
"FreeT (Producer ByteString m) m r\n"
"\n"
"where the 'Stream' type expresses the sequencing of 'ByteString m _' layers "
"with the usual 'free monad' sequencing.\n"
"\n"
"Interoperation with 'pipes-bytestring' uses this isomorphism:\n"
"\n"
"> Streaming.ByteString.unfoldrChunks Pipes.next :: Monad m => Producer "
"ByteString m r -> ByteString m r > Pipes.unfoldr Streaming.ByteString."
"nextChunk :: Monad m => ByteString m r -> Producer ByteString m r\n"
"\n"
"Interoperation with 'io-streams' is thus:\n"
"\n"
"> IOStreams.unfoldM Streaming.ByteString.unconsChunk :: ByteString IO () -> "
"IO (InputStream ByteString) > Streaming.ByteString.reread IOStreams.read :: "
"InputStream ByteString -> ByteString IO ()\n"
"\n"
"and similarly for other rational streaming io libraries.\n"

"It is common knowledge that lazy datastructures can lead to space-leaks. "
"This problem is particularly prominent, when using lazy datastructures to "
"store the state of a long-running application in memory. The easiest "
"solution to this problem is to use fully strict types to store such state "
"values. By \"fully strict types\" we mean types for whose values it holds "
"that, if they are in weak-head normal form, then they are also in normal "
"form. Intuitively, this means that values of fully strict types cannot "
"contain unevaluated thunks.\n"
"\n"
"To define a fully strict datatype, one typically uses the following recipe.\n"
"\n"
"1. Make all fields of every constructor strict; i.e., add a bang to all "
"fields.\n"
"\n"
"2. Use only strict types for the fields of the constructors.\n"
"\n"
"The second requirement is problematic as it rules out the use of the "
"standard Haskell 'Maybe', 'Either', and pair types. This library solves this "
"problem by providing strict variants of these types and their corresponding "
"standard support functions and type-class instances.\n"
"\n"
"Note that this library does currently not provide fully strict lists. They "
"can be added if they are really required. However, in many cases one "
"probably wants to use unboxed or strict boxed vectors from the 'vector' "
"library (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector>) instead of strict "

"Uniplate is library for writing simple and concise generic operations. "
"Uniplate has similar goals to the original Scrap Your Boilerplate work, but "
"is substantially simpler and faster. The Uniplate manual is available at "
"<http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/darcs/uniplate/uniplate.htm>.\n"
"\n"
"To get started with Uniplate you should import one of the three following "
"modules: \n"
"* \"Data.Generics.Uniplate.Data\" - to quickly start writing generic "
"functions. Most users should start by importing this module. \n"
"* \"Data.Generics.Uniplate.Direct\" - a replacement for \"Data.Generics."
"Uniplate.Data\" with substantially higher performance (around 5 times), but "
"requires writing instance declarations. \n"
"* \"Data.Generics.Uniplate.Operations\" - definitions of all the operations "
"defined by Uniplate. Both the above two modules re-export this module.\n"
"\n"
"In addition, some users may want to make use of the following modules: \n"
"* \"Data.Generics.Uniplate.Zipper\" - a zipper built on top of Uniplate "
"instances. \n"
"* \"Data.Generics.SYB\" - users transitioning from the Scrap Your "
"Boilerplate library. \n"
"* \"Data.Generics.Compos\" - users transitioning from the Compos library. \n"
"* \"Data.Generics.Uniplate.DataOnly\" - users making use of both 'Data' and "
"'Direct' to avoid getting instance conflicts."

"NOTE: If you're writing an app, you probably want <http://hackage.haskell."
"org/package/microlens-platform microlens-platform> – it has the most "
"features. <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens microlens> is "
"intended more for library writers who want a tiny lens library (after all, "
"lenses are pretty useful for everything, not just for updating records!).\n"
"\n"
"This library is an extract from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens "
"lens> (with no dependencies). It's not a toy lenses library, unsuitable for "
"“real world”, but merely a small one. It is compatible with lens, and should "
"have same performance. It also has better documentation.\n"
"\n"
"There's a longer readme <https://github.com/aelve/microlens#readme on "
"Github>. It has a migration guide for lens users, a description of other "
"packages in the family, a discussion of other lens libraries you could use "
"instead, and so on.\n"
"\n"
"Here are some usecases for this library: \n"
"* You want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but don't "
"want to depend on lens. Having lenses available often make working with a "
"library more pleasant. \n"
"* You just want to be able to use lenses to transform data (or even just use "
"'over _1' to change the first element of a tuple). \n"
"* You are new to lenses and want a small library to play with.\n"
"\n"
"However, don't use this library if: \n"
"* You need 'Iso's, 'Prism's, indexed traversals, or actually anything else "
"which isn't defined here (tho some indexed functions are available elsewhere "
"– containers and vector provide them for their types, and <http://hackage."
"haskell.org/package/ilist ilist> provides indexed functions for lists). \n"
"* You want a library with a clean, understandable implementation (in which "
"case you're looking for <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-simple lens-"
"simple>).\n"
"\n"
"As already mentioned, if you're writing an application which uses lenses "
"more extensively, look at <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-"
"platform microlens-platform> – it combines features of most other microlens "
"packages (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-mtl microlens-mtl>, "
"<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-th microlens-th>, <http://"
"hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-ghc microlens-ghc>).\n"
"\n"
"If you want to export getters or folds and don't mind the <http://hackage."
"haskell.org/package/contravariant contravariant> dependency, please consider "
"using <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-contra microlens-"
"contra>.\n"
"\n"
"If you haven't ever used lenses before, read <http://hackage.haskell.org/"
"package/lens-tutorial/docs/Control-Lens-Tutorial.html this tutorial>. (It's "
"for lens, but it applies to microlens just as well.)\n"
"\n"
"Note that microlens has no dependencies starting from GHC 7.10 (base-4.8). "
"Prior to that, it depends on transformers-0.2 or above."

"* The generator also implements an alternative version of the 'System.Random."
"TF.Gen.RandomGen' class (exported from \"System.Random.TF.Gen\"), which "

"* An alternative version of the 'Random' class is provided, which is linked "
"to the new 'RandomGen' class, together with 'Random' instances for some "

"* Two functions for initialising the generator with a non-deterministic "
"seed: one using the system time, and one using the '/dev/urandom' UNIX "
