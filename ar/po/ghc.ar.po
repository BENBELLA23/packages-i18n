msgid ""
"Do you ever feel the need to test code involving bottoms (e.g. calls to the "
"'error' function), or code involving infinite values? Then this library "
"could be useful for you.\n"
"\n"
"It is usually easy to get a grip on bottoms by showing a value and waiting "
"to see how much gets printed before the first exception is encountered. "
"However, that quickly gets tiresome and is hard to automate using e.g. "
"QuickCheck (<http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/>). With this "
"library you can do the tests as simply as the following examples show.\n"
"\n"
"Testing explicitly for bottoms:\n"
"\n"
"> > isBottom (head []) > True\n"
"\n"
"> > isBottom bottom > True\n"
"\n"
"> > isBottom (_ -> bottom) > False\n"
"\n"
"> > isBottom (bottom, bottom) > False\n"
"\n"
"Comparing finite, partial values:\n"
"\n"
"> > ((bottom, 3) :: (Bool, Int)) ==! (bottom, 2+5-4) > True\n"
"\n"
"> > ((bottom, bottom) :: (Bool, Int)) <! (bottom, 8) > True\n"
"\n"
"Showing partial and infinite values ('\\/!' is join and '/\\!' is meet):\n"
"\n"
"> > approxShow 4 $ (True, bottom) /! (bottom, 'b') > \"Just (True, 'b')\"\n"
"\n"
"> > approxShow 4 $ (True, bottom) /! (bottom, 'b') > \"(_|_, _|_)\"\n"
"\n"
"> > approxShow 4 $ ([1..] :: [Int]) > \"[1, 2, 3, _\"\n"
"\n"
"> > approxShow 4 $ (cycle [bottom] :: [Bool]) > \"[_|_, _|_, _|_, _\"\n"
"\n"
"Approximately comparing infinite, partial values:\n"
"\n"
"> > approx 100 [2,4..] ==! approx 100 (filter even [1..] :: [Int]) > True\n"
"\n"
"> > approx 100 [2,4..] /=! approx 100 (filter even [bottom..] :: [Int]) > "
"True\n"
"\n"
"The code above relies on the fact that 'bottom', just as 'error \"...\"', "
"'undefined' and pattern match failures, yield exceptions. Sometimes we are "
"dealing with properly non-terminating computations, such as the following "
"example, and then it can be nice to be able to apply a time-out:\n"
"\n"
"> > timeOut' 1 (reverse [1..5]) > Value [5,4,3,2,1]\n"
"\n"
"> > timeOut' 1 (reverse [1..]) > NonTermination\n"
"\n"
"The time-out functionality can be used to treat \"slow\" computations as "
"bottoms:\n"
"\n"
"' > let tweak = Tweak &#x7b; approxDepth = Just 5, timeOutLimit = Just 2 "
"&#x7d; > semanticEq tweak (reverse [1..], [1..]) (bottom :: [Int], [1..] :: "
"[Int]) True '\n"
"\n"
"' > let tweak = noTweak &#x7b; timeOutLimit = Just 2 &#x7d; > semanticJoin "
"tweak (reverse [1..], True) ([] :: [Int], bottom) Just ([],True) '\n"
"\n"
"This can of course be dangerous:\n"
"\n"
"' > let tweak = noTweak &#x7b; timeOutLimit = Just 0 &#x7d; > semanticEq "
"tweak (reverse [1..100000000]) (bottom :: [Integer]) True '\n"
"\n"
"Timeouts can also be applied to 'IO' computations:\n"
"\n"
"> > let primes () = unfoldr ((x:xs) -> Just (x, filter ((/= 0) . (`mod` x)) "
"xs)) [2..] > > timeOutMicro 100 (print $ primes ()) > [2,NonTermination > > "
"timeOutMicro 10000 (print $ take 10 $ primes ()) > "
"[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29] > Value ()\n"
"\n"
"For the underlying theory and a larger example involving use of QuickCheck, "
"see the article \"Chasing Bottoms, A Case Study in Program Verification in "
"the Presence of Partial and Infinite Values\" (<http://www.cse.chalmers.se/"
"~nad/publications/danielsson-jansson-mpc2004.html>).\n"
"\n"
"The code has been tested using GHC. Most parts can probably be ported to "
"other Haskell compilers, but this would require some work. The 'TimeOut' "
"functions require preemptive scheduling, and most of the rest requires 'Data."
"Generics'; 'isBottom' only requires exceptions, though."

"* \"Test.Framework\" now longer exports all of \"Test.Framework.TestManager"

msgid ""
"MFlow is a web framework that turns the mess of web programming from "
"handlers and configuration files back into sane and normal programming. Your "
"code is the website.\n"
"\n"
"The goals of MFlow are. ~~~ -Inverting back the inversion of control of web "
"applications and turn web programming into ordinary, intuitive, imperative-"
"like programming. \n"
"-At the same time, maintaining for the programmer all the freedom that they "
"have in web applications. MFlow keeps out of your way. \n"
"-For scalability-sensitive applications, no fat state snapshots that other "
"continuation-based frameworks need to cope with these two previous "
"requirements. State replication and horizontal scalability are central to "
"MFlow's philosophy. \n"
"-For REST advocates, MFlow maintains the elegant notation of REST URLs and "
"the statelessness of GET requests. \n"
"-For expert Haskell programmers, reuse of already existing web libraries and "
"techniques is trivial. \n"
"-For beginner programmers and for software engineers, MFlow provides a high "
"level DSL of reusable and self contained widgets for the user interface, and "
"multipage procedures that work together provided that they statically "
"typecheck with zero configuration. \n"
"-For highly interactive applications, MFlow gives dynamic widgets that have "
"their own behaviors in the page and they communicate without the need of "
"explicit JavaScript programming. \n"
"-No deployment, speed up the development process. see <http://haskell-web."
"blogspot.com.es/2013/05/a-web-application-in-tweet.html>\n"
"\n"
"How navigation works ~~~ MFlow solves the problem of re-inversion of control "
"by using a different approach, routes are expressed as normal monadic "
"Haskell code in the FlowM monad, local links point to alternative routes "
"within this monadic computation, this means any GET page is directly "
"reachable by means of a RESTful URL.\n"
"\n"
"At any moment the flow can respond to the back button or to any RESTful path "
"that the user may paste in the navigation bar. If the procedure is waiting "
"for another different page, the FlowM monad backtrack until the paths "
"partially match. From this position on the execution goes forward until the "
"rest of the paths match. Thus, no matter the previous state of the server "
"process it will recover the state of execution appropriate for the request. "
"This way the server process is virtually stateless for any GET request. It "
"is also possible to store a session state, which may backtrack or not, when "
"the navigation goes back and forth. MFlow keeps it all in sync, "
"synchronization between server state and web browser state is supported out-"
"of-the-box.\n"
"\n"
"When the state matters, and user interactions can last for long period of "
"time, such are shopping carts etc., MFlow uses a log for thread state "
"persistence. The server process shuts itself down after a programmer defined "
"timeout, once a new request of the same user arrives, the log is used to "
"recover the process state. There is no need to store a snapshot of every "
"continuation, just the result of each step. This solves the problem of fat "
"state snapshots and give a very lightweight way to handle state.\n"
"\n"
"Data tier ~~~ State consistency and transactions are handled by the TCache "
"package.\n"
"\n"
"www.hackage.haskell.org/package/TCache\n"
"\n"
"It is data cache within the STM monad (Software Transactional Memory), "
"serialization and deserialization of data is programmer defined. TCache can "
"adapt to any database, default persistence in files comes out of the box for "
"rapid development purposes, but you can switch to a variety of backends when "
"needed, see the database examples for more details.\n"
"\n"
"Widgets ~~~ The processes interact through widgets, which are an extension "
"of formlets with additional applicative combinators, formatting, link "
"management, callbacks, modifiers, caching, and AJAX. All of it is coded in "
"pure Haskell and you use pure Haskell to make your own widgets. Each widget "
"return statically typed data, they can dynamically modify themselves using "
"AJAX internally (just prefix it with auto refresh), are auto-contained: they "
"may include their own JavaScript code, server code and client code in a "
"single pure Haskell procedure that can be combined with other widgets with "
"no other configuration.\n"
"\n"
"To combine widgets, applicative combinators are used. Widgets with dynamic "
"behaviors that use the monadic syntax and callbacks. When you combine "
"widgets, everything is type checked and making large websites by gluing "
"together small reusable building blocks is the entire aim of the MFlow "
"project.\n"
"\n"
"Modularity ~~~ The interfaces and communications are abstract and there are "
"bindings for blaze-HTML, HSP, Text.XHtml, ByteString, Hack, and WAI. So it "
"can be extended to non web based architectures.\n"
"\n"
"Bindings for hack, and HSP >= 0.8, are not installed by default, but are "
"included in the package files. To use them, add them to the exported modules "
"and execute cabal install\n"
"\n"
"It is designed for applications that can be run with no deployment with "
"runghc in order to speed up the development process. see <http://haskell-web."

msgid ""
"A library to deal with application settings.\n"
"\n"
"This library deals with read-write application settings. You will have to "
"specify the settings that your application uses, their name, types and "
"default values.\n"
"\n"
"Setting types must implement the 'Read' and 'Show' typeclasses.\n"
"\n"
"The settings are saved in a file in an INI-like key-value format (without "
"sections).\n"
"\n"
"Reading and updating settings is done in pure code, the IO monad is only "
"used to load settings and save them to disk. It is advised for the user to "
"create a module in your project holding settings handling.\n"
"\n"
"You can then declare settings:\n"
"\n"
"> fontSize :: Setting Double > fontSize = Setting \"fontSize\" 14 > > "
"dateFormat :: Setting String > dateFormat = Setting \"dateFormat\" \"%{x}\" "
"> > backgroundColor :: Setting (Int, Int, Int) > backgroundColor = Setting "
"\"backcolor\" (255, 0, 0)\n"
"\n"
"Optionally you can declare the list of all your settings, in that case the "
"application will also save the default values in the configuration file, but "
"commented out:\n"
"\n"
"> fontSize=16 > # dateFormat=\"%x\" > # backcolor=(255,0,0)\n"
"\n"
"If you do not specify the list of settings, only the first line would be "
"present in the configuration file.\n"
"\n"
"With an ordinary setting, one row in the configuration file means one "
"setting. That setting may of course be a list for instance. This setup works "
"very well for shorter lists like [1,2,3], however if you have a list of more "
"complex items, you will get very long lines and a configuration file very "
"difficult to edit by hand.\n"
"\n"
"For these special cases there is also the 'ListSetting' constructor:\n"
"\n"
"> testList :: Setting [String] > testList = ListSetting \"testList"
"\" [\"list1\", \"list2\", \"list3\"]\n"
"\n"
"Now the configuration file looks like that:\n"
"\n"
"> testList_1=\"list1\" > testList_2=\"list2\" > testList_3=\"list3\"\n"
"\n"
"Which is much more handy for big lists. An empty list is represented like "
"so:\n"
"\n"
"> testList=\n"
"\n"
"There is also another technique that you can use if you have too long lines: "
"you can put line breaks in the setting values if you start the following "
"lines with a leading space, like so:\n"
"\n"
"> testList=[\"list1\", > \"list2\", \"list3\"]\n"
"\n"
"In that case don't use the ListSetting option. Any character after the the "
"leading space in the next lines will go in the setting value. Note that the "
"library will automatically wrap setting values longer than 80 characters "
"when saving.\n"
"\n"
"Once we declared the settings, we can read the configuration from disk (and "
"your settings module should export your wrapper around the function offered "
"by this library):\n"
"\n"
"> readResult <- try $ readSettings (AutoFromAppName \"test\") > case "
"readResult of > Right (conf, GetSetting getSetting) -> do > let textSize = "
"getSetting fontSize > saveSettings emptyDefaultConfig (AutoFromAppName \"test"
"\") conf > Left (x :: SomeException) -> error \"Error reading the config "
"file!\"\n"
"\n"
"'AutoFromAppName' specifies where to save the configuration file. And we've "
"already covered the getSetting in this snippet, see the 'readSettings' "
"documentation for further information.\n"
"\n"
"You can also look at the tests of the library on the github project for "
"sample use."

"/auto/ is a Haskell DSL and platform providing declarative, compositional, "
"denotative semantics for discrete-step, locally stateful, interactive "
"programs, games, and automations, with implicitly derived serialization. It "
"is suited for any domain where either the input or the output can be "
"described as a stream of values: a stream of input events, output views, "
"etc.\n"
"\n"
"/auto/ works by providing a type that encapsulates \"value stream "
"transformers\", or locally stateful functions; by specifying your program as "
"a (potentially cyclic) graph of relationships between value streams, you "
"create a way of \"declaring\" a system based simply on static relationships "
"between quantities.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of a \"state monad\" type solution, where all functions have access "
"to a rigid global state, /auto/ works by specifying relationships which each "
"exist independently and on their own, without any global state.\n"
"\n"
"A more fuller exposition is in the `README.md`, in this project directory "
"and also online at <https://github.com/mstksg/auto/blob/master/README.md>; "
"you can get started by reading the tutorial, which is also in this project "
"directory in the `tutorial` directory, and also incidentally online at "
"<https://github.com/mstksg/auto/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.md>. Also, "
"check out the <https://github.com/mstksg/auto-examples auto-examples> "
"repository on github for plenty of real-world and toy examples to learn "
"from; I've also done a <http://blog.jle.im/entries/series/+all-about-auto "
"blog series> on this library, with examples and full tutorials!\n"
"\n"
"Support available on freenode's #haskell-auto, #haskell-game, and also on "
"the github issue tracker for the source repository.\n"
"\n"
"Import \"Control.Auto\" to begin!."

"\n"
"This package provides varieties of binary search functions. c.f. \"Numeric."
"Search\" for the examples.\n"
"\n"
"These search function can search for pure and monadic predicates, of type:\n"
"\n"
"> pred :: Eq b => a -> b > pred :: (Eq b, Monad m) => a -> m b\n"
"\n"
"The predicates must satisfy that the domain range for any codomain value is "
"continuous; that is, '∀x≦y≦z. pred x == pred z ⇒ pred y == pred x' .\n"
"\n"
"For example, we can address the problem of finding the boundary of an upward-"
"closed set of integers, using a combination of exponential and binary "
"searches.\n"
"\n"
"Variants are provided for searching within bounded and unbounded intervals "
"of both 'Integer' and bounded integral types.\n"
"\n"
"The package was created by Ross Paterson, and extended by Takayuki "
"Muranushi, to be used together with SMT solvers.\n"
"\n"
"__The Module Structure__ \n"
"* \"Numeric.Search\" provides the generic search combinator, to search for "
"pure and monadic predicates. * \"Numeric.Search.Bounded\" , \"Numeric.Search."
"Integer\" , \"Numeric.Search.Range\" provides the various specialized "
"searchers, which means less number of function arguments, and easier to "

"Inspired by Erlang's simple message-passing facilities, courier provides "

"endpoint bound to its transport.\n"
"\n"
"A primary driver of this package's design is separation of concerns: many "

"passing foundation, but the algorithms are sufficiently complex that the "
"details of how those messages are transmitted among nodes are best hidden "

"support for common communication idioms (e.g., in order message delivery, "
"selective out of order message delivery, synchronous RPC, etc.).\n"
"\n"
"Applications may process messages in the order received at an endpoint, or "
"use selective message reception to process the first message arriving at an "
"endpoint that also matches a provided selection function. Through selective "
"message reception, applications may approximate the style of an Erlang "

msgid ""
"In Haskell 98 the name of a record field is automatically also the name of a "
"function which gets the value of the according field. E.g. if we have\n"
"\n"
"data Pair a b = Pair first :: a, second :: b\n"
"\n"
"then\n"
"\n"
"> first :: Pair a b -> a > second :: Pair a b -> b\n"
"\n"
"However for setting or modifying a field value we need to use some syntactic "
"sugar, which is often clumsy.\n"
"\n"
"modifyFirst :: (a -> a) -> (Pair a b -> Pair a b) modifyFirst f r@(Pair "
"first=a ) = r first = f a\n"
"\n"
"With this package you can define record field accessors which allow setting, "
"getting and modifying values easily. The package clearly demonstrates the "
"power of the functional approach: You can combine accessors of a record and "
"sub-records, to make the access look like the fields of the sub-record "
"belong to the main record.\n"
"\n"
"Example:\n"
"\n"
"> *Data.Accessor.Example> (first^:second^=10) (('b',7),\"hallo\") > "
"(('b',10),\"hallo\")\n"
"\n"
"You can easily manipulate record fields in a 'Control.Monad.State.State' "
"monad, you can easily code 'Show' instances that use the Accessor syntax and "
"you can parse binary streams into records. See 'Data.Accessor.Example' for "
"demonstration of all features.\n"
"\n"
"It would be great if in revised Haskell versions the names of record fields "
"are automatically 'Data.Accessor.Accessor's rather than plain 'get' "
"functions. For now, the package 'data-accessor-template' provides Template "
"Haskell functions for automated generation of 'Data.Acesssor.Accessor's. See "
"also the other 'data-accessor' packages that provide an Accessor interface "
"to other data types. The package 'enumset' provides accessors to bit-packed "
"records.\n"
"\n"
"For similar packages see 'lenses' and 'fclabel'. A related concept are "
"editors <http://conal.net/blog/posts/semantic-editor-combinators/>. Editors "
"only consist of a modify method (and 'modify' applied to a 'const' function "
"is a 'set' function). This way, they can modify all function values of a "
"function at once, whereas an accessor can only change a single function "
"value, say, it can change 'f 0 = 1' to 'f 0 = 2'. This way, editors can even "
"change the type of a record or a function. An Arrow instance can be defined "
"for editors, but for accessors only a Category instance is possible ('(.)' "
"method). The reason is the 'arr' method of the 'Arrow' class, that conflicts "
"with the two-way nature (set and get) of accessors."

"with a single 'cabal install diagrams' command.\n"
"\n"
"The package also comes with flags to enable six different backends. A "
"Haskell-native SVG backend (the 'diagrams-svg' package) can be selected with "
"'-fsvg'. This flag is enabled by default, so if you do /not/ want the SVG "
"backend, you must explicitly disable it with '-f-svg'. The SVG backend does "
"not yet quite support all the features of the cairo backend: text alignment "
"and embedded images are the two main missing features at this point, and of "
"course it can only produce SVG images. It is, however, much easier to "
"install, so it is the out-of-the-box default.\n"
"\n"
"There is also a cairo backend (the 'diagrams-cairo' package) which can be "
"selected with the '-fcairo' flag. It is fully-featured and can produce PNG, "
"PS, PDF, SVG, or animated GIF output; however, due to its dependencies it "
"can be difficult to install on some platforms (notably OS X).\n"
"\n"
"In addition, there is a GTK backend based on the cairo backend, for "
"rendering diagrams directly to GTK windows. You can enable it with the '-"
"fgtk' flag.\n"
"\n"
"The Haskell-native postscript backend (the 'diagrams-postscript' package) "
"can be selected with the '-fpostscript' flag. The only feature it does not "
"support is transparency.\n"
"\n"
"There is a Rasterific backend which is also Haskell-native (the 'diagrams-"
"rasterific' package) which can be selected with the '-frasterific' flag. "
"This is a fully featured backend with the ability to produce PNG, JPG, TIFF, "
"BMP and animated GIF output.\n"
"\n"
"Finally there is a Canvas backend, also haskell native, which can be "
"selected with the '-fcanvas' flag. This backend allows users to write "
"interactive images onto their web browsers.\n"

"Provides a simple data structure mirroring a directory tree on the "

"We can characterise the state of a concurrent computation by considering the "

"can be performed in any order without affecting the result. DPOR is a "
"technique for computing these partial orders at run-time, and only testing "

msgid ""
"This package provides a couple of different implementations of mutable hash "
"tables in the ST monad, as well as a typeclass abstracting their common "
"operations, and a set of wrappers to use the hash tables in the IO monad.\n"
"\n"
"/QUICK START/: documentation for the hash table operations is provided in "
"the \"Data.HashTable.Class\" module, and the IO wrappers (which most users "
"will probably prefer) are located in the \"Data.HashTable.IO\" module.\n"
"\n"
"This package currently contains three hash table implementations:\n"
"\n"
"1. \"Data.HashTable.ST.Cuckoo\" contains an implementation of \"cuckoo "
"hashing\" as introduced by Pagh and Rodler in 2001 (see <http://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/Cuckoo_hashing>). Cuckoo hashing has worst-case /O(1)/ lookups and "
"can reach a high \"load factor\", in which the table can perform acceptably "
"well even when approaching 90% full. Randomized testing shows this "
"implementation of cuckoo hashing to be slightly faster on insert and "
"slightly slower on lookup than \"Data.Hashtable.ST.Basic\", while being more "
"space efficient by about a half-word per key-value mapping. Cuckoo hashing, "
"like the basic hash table implementation using linear probing, can suffer "
"from long delays when the table is resized.\n"
"\n"
"2. \"Data.HashTable.ST.Basic\" contains a basic open-addressing hash table "
"using linear probing as the collision strategy. On a pure speed basis it "
"should currently be the fastest available Haskell hash table implementation "
"for lookups, although it has a higher memory overhead than the other tables "
"and can suffer from long delays when the table is resized because all of the "
"elements in the table need to be rehashed.\n"
"\n"
"3. \"Data.HashTable.ST.Linear\" contains a linear hash table (see <http://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_hashing>), which trades some insert and lookup "
"performance for higher space efficiency and much shorter delays when "
"expanding the table. In most cases, benchmarks show this table to be "
"currently slightly faster than 'Data.HashTable' from the Haskell base "
"library.\n"
"\n"
"It is recommended to create a concrete type alias in your code when using "
"this package, i.e.:\n"
"\n"
"> import qualified Data.HashTable.IO as H > > type HashTable k v = H."
"BasicHashTable k v > > foo :: IO (HashTable Int Int) > foo = do > ht <- H."
"new > H.insert ht 1 1 > return ht\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, this makes it easy to switch to a different hash table "
"implementation, and secondly, using a concrete type rather than leaving your "
"functions abstract in the HashTable class should allow GHC to optimize away "
"the typeclass dictionaries.\n"
"\n"
"This package accepts a couple of different cabal flags: \n"
"* 'unsafe-tricks', default /ON/. If this flag is enabled, we use some unsafe "
"GHC-specific tricks to save indirections (namely 'unsafeCoerce#' and "
"'reallyUnsafePtrEquality#'. These techniques rely on assumptions about the "
"behaviour of the GHC runtime system and, although they've been tested and "
"should be safe under normal conditions, are slightly dangerous. Caveat "
"emptor. In particular, these techniques are incompatible with HPC code "
"coverage reports. \n"
"* 'sse42', default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, we use some SSE 4.2 "
"instructions (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4>, first available on "
"Intel Core 2 processors) to speed up cache-line searches for cuckoo "
"hashing. \n"
"* 'bounds-checking', default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, array accesses "
"are bounds-checked. \n"
"* 'debug', default /OFF/. If turned on, we'll rudely spew debug output to "
"stdout. \n"
"* 'portable', default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, we use only pure "
"Haskell code and try not to use unportable GHC extensions. Turning this flag "
"on forces 'unsafe-tricks' and 'sse42' /OFF/.\n"

"Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to "

"advantages:\n"
"\n"
"[Compatibility with Latest Stable Redis:] Hedis is intended to be used with "
"the latest stable version of Redis (currently 3.2). Most redis commands "
"(<http://redis.io/commands>) are available as haskell functions, although "
"MONITOR and SYNC are intentionally omitted. Additionally, a low-level API is "
"exposed that makes it easy for the library user to implement further "
"commands, such as new commands from an experimental Redis version.\n"
"\n"
"[Automatic Optimal Pipelining:] Commands are pipelined (<http://redis.io/"
"topics/pipelining>) as much as possible without any work by the user. See "
"<http://informatikr.com/2012/redis-pipelining.html> for a technical "
"explanation of automatic optimal pipelining.\n"
"\n"
"[Enforced Pub/Sub semantics:] When subscribed to the Redis Pub/Sub server "
"(<http://redis.io/topics/pubsub>), clients are not allowed to issue commands "
"other than subscribing to or unsubscribing from channels. This library uses "
"the type system to enforce the correct behavior.\n"
"\n"
"[Connect via TCP or Unix Domain Socket:] TCP sockets are the default way to "
"connect to a Redis server. For connections to a server on the same machine, "
"Unix domain sockets offer higher performance than the standard TCP "
"connection.\n"

"The 'HFlags' library supports easy definition of command line flags, "
"reimplementing the ideas from Google's 'gflags' (<http://code.google.com/p/"
"gflags>).\n"
"\n"
"Command line flags can be declared in any file at the toplevel, using "
"'defineFlag'. At runtime, the actual values are assigned to the toplevel "
"'flags_name' constants. Those can be used purely throughout the program.\n"
"\n"
"At the beginning of the 'main' function, '$initHFlags \"program description"
"\"' has to be called to initialize the flags. All flags will be initialized "
"that are transitively reachable via imports from 'main'. This means, that "
"any Haskell package can easily define command line flags with 'HFlags'. This "
"feature is demonstrated by <http://github.com/errge/hflags/blob/master/"

"This package comes \"Batteries Included\" with many useful lenses for the "
"types commonly used from the Haskell Platform, and with tools for "
"automatically generating lenses and isomorphisms for user-supplied data "
"types.\n"
"\n"
"The combinators in 'Control.Lens' provide a highly generic toolbox for "
"composing families of getters, folds, isomorphisms, traversals, setters and "
"lenses and their indexed variants.\n"
"\n"
"An overview, with a large number of examples can be found in the <https://"
"github.com/ekmett/lens#lens-lenses-folds-and-traversals README>.\n"
"\n"
"An introductory video on the style of code used in this library by Simon "
"Peyton Jones is available from <http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/lenses-"
"compositional-data-access-and-manipulation Skills Matter>.\n"
"\n"
"A video on how to use lenses and how they are constructed is available on "

"\n"
"Slides for that second talk can be obtained from <http://comonad.com/haskell/"

"\n"
"More information on the care and feeding of lenses, including a brief "
"tutorial and motivation for their types can be found on the <https://github."

"With some signatures simplified, the core of the hierarchy of lens-like "
"constructions looks like:\n"
"\n"
"<<http://i.imgur.com/ALlbPRa.png>>\n"
"\n"
"<Hierarchy.png (Local Copy)>\n"
"\n"
"You can compose any two elements of the hierarchy above using '(.)' from the "
"'Prelude', and you can use any element of the hierarchy as any type it "
"linked to above it.\n"
"\n"
"The result is their lowest upper bound in the hierarchy (or an error if that "
"bound doesn't exist).\n"
"\n"
"For instance: \n"
"* You can use any 'Traversal' as a 'Fold' or as a 'Setter'. \n"
"* The composition of a 'Traversal' and a 'Getter' yields a 'Fold'.\n"
"\n"
"/Minimizing Dependencies/\n"
"\n"
"If you want to provide lenses and traversals for your own types in your own "
"libraries, then you can do so without incurring a dependency on this (or any "
"other) lens package at all.\n"
"\n"
"/e.g./ for a data type:\n"
"\n"
"> data Foo a = Foo Int Int a\n"
"\n"
"You can define lenses such as\n"
"\n"
"> -- bar :: Lens' (Foo a) Int > bar :: Functor f => (Int -> f Int) -> Foo a -"
"> f (Foo a) > bar f (Foo a b c) = fmap (a' -> Foo a' b c) (f a)\n"
"\n"
"> -- quux :: Lens (Foo a) (Foo b) a b > quux :: Functor f => (a -> f b) -> "
"Foo a -> f (Foo b) > quux f (Foo a b c) = fmap (Foo a b) (f c)\n"
"\n"
"without the need to use any type that isn't already defined in the "
"'Prelude'.\n"
"\n"
"And you can define a traversal of multiple fields with 'Control.Applicative."
"Applicative':\n"
"\n"
"> -- traverseBarAndBaz :: Traversal' (Foo a) Int > traverseBarAndBaz :: "
"Applicative f => (Int -> f Int) -> Foo a -> f (Foo a) > traverseBarAndBaz f "
"(Foo a b c) = Foo <$> f a <*> f b <*> pure c\n"
"\n"
"What is provided in this library is a number of stock lenses and traversals "
"for common haskell types, a wide array of combinators for working them, and "

"This module, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-simple/docs/Lens-"
"Simple.html Lens.Simple>, just re-exports the main modules from Russell "
"O'Connor's <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family lens-family> "
"package, the original van Laarhoven-O'Connor lens library. 'lens-family' is "
"particularly remarkable for its minute number of dependencies: (apart from "
"<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl mtl> they are all ghc 'boot' "
"libraries); but more importantly for its extreme conceptual simplicity and "
"theoretical soundness. Much of the material it contains is well-explained, "
"from a tutorial point of view, by <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-"
"tutorial lens-tutorial> It is independent, self-standing and readily "
"intelligible apart from any darker more general system of combinators that "
"might attempt to extend it. Much of it ought to be in the Prelude.\n"
"\n"
"Convenient import of the elementary combinators from 'lens-family', however, "
"a little complicated. The idea of this trivial module, then, is just to make "
"a sort of low-powered, minimal-dependency, 'lens-family' equivalent of the "
"800 lb gorilla of lens library imports:\n"

"\n"
"namely, the light-weight and elegant:\n"

"Lens-Tutorial.html source> and follow along as prompted.\n"
"\n"
"As another illustration of the simplicity of the fundamental van Laarhoven-"
"O'Connor lens combinators - and their homogeneity with 'Control.Lens'\n"
"- note that the gloss <https://github.com/michaelt/lens-family-simple/blob/"
"master/examples/Pong.hs pong example> from the 'lens' library examples "
"directory - which continues to be among the best introductory lens tutorials "
"precisely by saying nothing - requires only this abbreviating change of "
"imports.\n"
"\n"
"If you make that program more complicated, you might of course end up "
"needing the more sophisticated material in 'Control.Lens' and its immense "
"mass of dependencies. On the other hand, you might just need some of the "
"additional material present in the similarly demystifying <http://hackage."

"NOTE: If you're writing an app, you probably want <http://hackage.haskell."
"org/package/microlens-platform microlens-platform> – it has the most "
"features. <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens microlens> is "
"intended more for library writers who want a tiny lens library (after all, "
"lenses are pretty useful for everything, not just for updating records!).\n"
"\n"
"This library is an extract from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens "
"lens> (with no dependencies). It's not a toy lenses library, unsuitable for "
"“real world”, but merely a small one. It is compatible with lens, and should "
"have same performance. It also has better documentation.\n"
"\n"
"There's a longer readme <https://github.com/aelve/microlens#readme on "
"Github>. It has a migration guide for lens users, a description of other "
"packages in the family, a discussion of other lens libraries you could use "
"instead, and so on.\n"
"\n"
"Here are some usecases for this library: \n"
"* You want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but don't "
"want to depend on lens. Having lenses available often make working with a "
"library more pleasant. \n"
"* You just want to be able to use lenses to transform data (or even just use "
"'over _1' to change the first element of a tuple). \n"
"* You are new to lenses and want a small library to play with.\n"
"\n"
"However, don't use this library if: \n"
"* You need 'Iso's, 'Prism's, indexed traversals, or actually anything else "
"which isn't defined here (tho some indexed functions are available elsewhere "
"– containers and vector provide them for their types, and <http://hackage."
"haskell.org/package/ilist ilist> provides indexed functions for lists). \n"
"* You want a library with a clean, understandable implementation (in which "
"case you're looking for <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-simple lens-"
"simple>).\n"
"\n"
"As already mentioned, if you're writing an application which uses lenses "
"more extensively, look at <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-"
"platform microlens-platform> – it combines features of most other microlens "
"packages (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-mtl microlens-mtl>, "
"<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-th microlens-th>, <http://"
"hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-ghc microlens-ghc>).\n"
"\n"
"If you want to export getters or folds and don't mind the <http://hackage."

"for lens, but it applies to microlens just as well.)\n"

"\"Network.Transport\" is a Network Abstraction Layer which provides the "
"following high-level concepts: \n"
"* Nodes in the network are represented by 'EndPoint's. These are heavyweight "
"stateful objects. \n"
"* Each 'EndPoint' has an 'EndPointAddress'. \n"
"* Connections can be established from one 'EndPoint' to another using the "
"'EndPointAddress' of the remote end. \n"
"* The 'EndPointAddress' can be serialised and sent over the network, where "
"as 'EndPoint's and connections cannot. \n"
"* Connections between 'EndPoint's are unidirectional and lightweight. \n"
"* Outgoing messages are sent via a 'Connection' object that represents the "
"sending end of the connection. \n"
"* Incoming messages for /all/ of the incoming connections on an 'EndPoint' "
"are collected via a shared receive queue. \n"
"* In addition to incoming messages, 'EndPoint's are notified of other "
"'Event's such as new connections or broken connections.\n"
"\n"
"This design was heavily influenced by the design of the Common Communication "
"Interface (<http://www.olcf.ornl.gov/center-projects/common-communication-"
"interface>). Important design goals are: \n"
"* Connections should be lightweight: it should be no problem to create "
"thousands of connections between endpoints. \n"
"* Error handling is explicit: every function declares as part of its type "
"which errors it can return (no exceptions are thrown) \n"
"* Error handling is \"abstract\": errors that originate from implementation "
"specific problems (such as \"no more sockets\" in the TCP implementation) "
"get mapped to generic errors (\"insufficient resources\") at the Transport "
"level.\n"
"\n"
"This package provides the generic interface only; you will probably also "
"want to install at least one transport implementation (network-transport-*)."

msgid ""
"'proxied' is a simple library that exports a function to convert constant "
"functions to ones that take a 'proxy' value in the \"Data.Proxied\" module. "
"This is useful for retrofiting typeclasses that have functions that return a "
"constant value for any value of a particular type (but still need to consume "
"some value, since one of the parameterized types must appear in a typeclass "
"function). Often, these functions are given 'undefined' as an argument, "
"which might be considered poor design.\n"
"\n"
"'Proxy', however, does not carry any of the error-throwing risks of "
"'undefined', so it is much more preferable to take 'Proxy' as an argument to "
"a constant function instead of 'undefined'. Unfortunately, 'Proxy' was "
"included in 'base' until GHC 7.8, so many of 'base''s typeclasses still "
"contain constant functions that aren't amenable to passing 'Proxy'. "
"'proxied' addresses this issue by providing variants of those typeclass "
"functions that take an explicit 'proxy' value.\n"
"\n"
"This library also contains the \"Data.Proxyless\" module, which works in the "
"opposite direction. That is, one can take functions which take 'Proxy' (or "
"'undefined') as an argument and convert them to functions which take no "
"arguments. This trick relies on the '-XTypeApplications' extension, so it is "
"only available with GHC 8.0 or later."

"\n"
"References are more general than field selectors in traditional languages. \n"
"* References are first-class values. If there is a struct in C, for example, "
"with an `int` field `fl`, then fl can only be used as part of an expression. "
"One can not generalize a function to take a field selector and transform the "
"selected data or use it in other ways. \n"
"* They can have different meanings, while field accessors can only represent "
"data-level containment. They can express uncertain containment (like field "
"selectors of C unions), different viewpoints of the same data, and other "
"concepts.\n"
"\n"
"There are two things that references can do but the previously mentioned "

"This library encourages you to do memoization in three separate steps:\n"
"\n"
"(1) Create a memoizable function\n"
"\n"
"(2) Create or select an appropriate memoizer\n"
"\n"
"(3) Run the memoizer on the memoizable function\n"
"\n"
"Let's start with the first. When you create a memoizable function, you "
"should use the 'self' convention, which is that the first input to the "
"function is 'self', and all recursive calls are replaced with 'self'. One "
"common convention that goes well with the 'self' convention is using a "
"helper function 'go', like so:\n"
"\n"
"' fib :: Memoizable (Integer -> Integer) fib self = go where go 0 = 1 go 1 = "
"1 go n = self (n-1) + self (n-2) '\n"
"\n"
"Now for the second. For this example, we need a Memoizer that can handle an "
"'Integer' input, and an 'Integer' output. 'Data.MemoCombinators' provides "
"'integral', which handles any 'Integral' input, and any output. 'Data."
"MemoUgly' provides 'memo', which can memoize any function 'a -> b', given an "
"'Ord' instance for 'a'.\n"
"\n"
"Third, let's run our memoizers! Since we have decoupled the definition of "
"the memoized function from its actual memoization, we can create multiple "
"memoized versions of the same function if we so desire.\n"
"\n"
"' import qualified Data.MemoUgly as Ugly import qualified Data."
"MemoCombinators as MC\n"
"\n"
"fibUgly :: Integer -> Integer fibUgly = runMemo Ugly.memo fib\n"
"\n"
"fibMC :: Integer -> Integer fibMC = runMemo MC.integral fib '\n"
"\n"
"You could easily do the same with 'Data.MemoTrie.memo', 'Data.Function."
"Memoize.memoize', etc.\n"
"\n"
"Using this technique, you can create local memoized functions whose memo "
"tables are garbage collected as soon as they are no longer needed."

"Provides a wide array of (semi)groupoids and operations for working with "
"them.\n"
"\n"
"A 'Semigroupoid' is a 'Category' without the requirement of identity arrows "
"for every object in the category.\n"
"\n"
"A 'Category' is any 'Semigroupoid' for which the Yoneda lemma holds.\n"
"\n"
"When working with comonads you often have the '<*>' portion of an "
"'Applicative', but not the 'pure'. This was captured in Uustalu and Vene's "
"\"Essence of Dataflow Programming\" in the form of the 'ComonadZip' class in "
"the days before 'Applicative'. Apply provides a weaker invariant, but for "
"the comonads used for data flow programming (found in the streams package), "
"this invariant is preserved. Applicative function composition forms a "
"semigroupoid.\n"
"\n"
"Similarly many structures are nearly a comonad, but not quite, for instance "
"lists provide a reasonable 'extend' operation in the form of 'tails', but do "
"not always contain a value.\n"
"\n"
"Ideally the following relationships would hold:\n"
"\n"
"> Foldable ----> Traversable <--- Functor ------> Alt ---------> Plus "
"Semigroupoid > | | | | | > v v v v v > Foldable1 ---> Traversable1 Apply\n"
"--------> Applicative -> Alternative Category > | | | | > v v v v > Bind\n"
"---------> Monad -------> MonadPlus Arrow >\n"
"\n"
"Apply, Bind, and Extend (not shown) give rise the Static, Kleisli and "
"Cokleisli semigroupoids respectively.\n"
"\n"
"This lets us remove many of the restrictions from various monad transformers "
"as in many cases the binding operation or '<*>' operation does not require "
"them.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, to work with these weaker structures it is beneficial to have "
"containers that can provide stronger guarantees about their contents, so "
"versions of 'Traversable' and 'Foldable' that can be folded with just a "
"'Semigroup' are added."

msgid ""
"The 'set-monad' library exports the 'Set' abstract data type and set-"
"manipulating functions. These functions behave exactly as their namesakes "
"from the 'Data.Set' module of the 'containers' library. In addition, the "
"'set-monad' library extends 'Data.Set' by providing 'Functor', "
"'Applicative', 'Alternative', 'Foldable', 'Monad', and 'MonadPlus' instances "
"for sets.\n"
"\n"
"In other words, you can use the 'set-monad' library as a drop-in replacement "
"for the 'Data.Set' module of the 'containers' library and, in addition, you "
"will also get the aforementioned instances which are not available in the "
"'containers' package.\n"
"\n"
"It is not possible to directly implement instances for the aforementioned "
"standard Haskell type classes for the 'Set' data type from the 'containers' "
"library. This is because the key operations 'map' and 'union', are "
"constrained with 'Ord' as follows.\n"
"\n"
"> map :: (Ord a, Ord b) => (a -> b) -> Set a -> Set b > union :: (Ord a) => "
"Set a -> Set a -> Set a\n"
"\n"
"The 'set-monad' library provides the type class instances by wrapping the "
"constrained 'Set' type into a data type that has unconstrained constructors "
"corresponding to monadic combinators. The data type constructors that "
"represent monadic combinators are evaluated with a constrained run function. "
"This elevates the need to use the constraints in the instance definitions "
"(this is what prevents a direct definition). The wrapping and unwrapping "
"happens internally in the library and does not affect its interface.\n"
"\n"
"For details, see the rather compact definitions of the 'run' function and "
"type class instances. The left identity and associativity monad laws play a "
"crucial role in the definition of the 'run' function. The rest of the code "
"should be self explanatory.\n"
"\n"
"The technique is not new. This library was inspired by [1]. To my knowledge, "
"the original, systematic presentation of the idea to represent monadic "
"combinators as data is given in [2]. There is also a Haskell library that "
"provides a generic infrastructure for the aforementioned wrapping and "
"unwrapping [3].\n"
"\n"
"The 'set-monad' library is particularly useful for writing set-oriented code "
"using the do and/or monad comprehension notations. For example, the "
"following definitions now type check.\n"
"\n"
"> s1 :: Set (Int,Int) > s1 = do a <- fromList [1 .. 4] > b <- fromList [1 .. "
"4] > return (a,b)\n"
"\n"
"> -- with -XMonadComprehensions > s2 :: Set (Int,Int) > s2 = [ (a,b) | (a,b) "
"<- s1, even a, even b ]\n"
"\n"
"> s3 :: Set Int > s3 = fmap (+1) (fromList [1 .. 4])\n"
"\n"
"As noted in [1], the implementation technique can be used for monadic "
"libraries and EDSLs with restricted types (compiled EDSLs often restrict the "
"types that they can handle). Haskell's standard monad type class can be used "
"for restricted monad instances. There is no need to resort to GHC extensions "
"that rebind the standard monadic combinators with the library or EDSL "
"specific ones.\n"

"Vanilla thread management in Haskell is low level and it does not approach "

"typical problems arise: \n"
"* When a forked thread dies due to an uncaught exception, the exception does "
"not get raised in the main thread, which is why the program continues to run "
"as if nothing happened, i.e., with the presumption that the already dead "
"thread is running normally. Naturally this may very well bring your program "

"This package provides speculative function application and speculative "
"folds. Speculative STM transactions take the place of the transactional "
"rollback machinery from the paper.\n"
"\n"
"For example:\n"
"\n"
"''spec' g f a' evaluates 'f g' while forcing 'a', if 'g == a' then 'f g' is "
"returned, otherwise 'f a' is evaluated and returned. Furthermore, if the "
"argument has already been evaluated, we skip the 'f g' computation entirely. "
"If a good guess at the value of 'a' is available, this is one way to induce "
"parallelism in an otherwise sequential task. However, if the guess isn't "
"available more cheaply than the actual answer, then this saves no work and "
"if the guess is wrong, you risk evaluating the function twice. Under high "
"load, since 'f g' is computed via the spark queue, the speculation will be "
"skipped and you will obtain the same answer as 'f $! a'.\n"
"\n"
"The best-case timeline looks like:\n"
"\n"
"> foreground: [----- a -----] > foreground: [-] (check g == a) > spark: "
"[----- f g -----] > overall: [--- spec g f a ---]\n"
"\n"
"The worst-case timeline looks like:\n"
"\n"
"> foreground: [----- a -----] > foreground: [-] (check g == a) > foreground: "
"[---- f a ----] > spark: [----- f g -----] > overall: [-------- spec g f a\n"
"---------]\n"
"\n"
"Note that, if 'f g' takes longer than a to compute, in the HEAD release of "
"GHC, 'f g' will be collected and killed during garbage collection.\n"
"\n"
"> foreground: [----- a -----] > foreground: [-] (check g == a) > foreground: "
"[---- f a ----] > spark: [---- f g ----###### (#'s mark when this spark is "
"collectable) > overall: [--------- spec g f a --------]\n"
"\n"
"Under high load:\n"
"\n"
"> foreground: [----- a -----] > foreground: [-] (check g == a) > foreground: "
"[---- f a ----] > overall: [-------- spec g f a ---------]\n"
"\n"
"Compare these to the timeline of 'f $! a':\n"
"\n"
"> foreground: [----- a -----] > foreground: [---- f a ----] > orverall: "
"[---------- f $! a ---------]\n"
"\n"
"'specSTM' provides a similar time table for STM actions, but also rolls back "
"side-effects. The one unfortunate operational distinction is that it is "
"forced to compute 'a' in the background thread and therefore degrades "
"slightly less gracefully under load, although we mitigate this effect by "
"only enqueuing if the number of sparks for the current capability is lower "
"than the total number of capabilities, to try to avoid wasting time when all "
"computational resources are in use."

"With this package you can build a Storable instance of a record type from "
"Storable instances of its elements in an elegant way. It does not do any "
"magic, just a bit arithmetic to compute the right offsets, that would be "
"otherwise done manually or by a preprocessor like C2HS. I cannot promise "
"that the generated memory layout is compatible with that of a corresponding "
"C struct. However, the module generates the smallest layout that is possible "
"with respect to the alignment of the record elements. If you encounter, that "
"a record does not have a compatible layout, we should fix that. But also "
"without C compatibility this package is useful e.g. in connection with "
"StorableVector.\n"
"\n"
"We provide Storable instance support for several cases: \n"
"* If you wrap a type in a 'newtype', then you can lift its 'Storable' "
"instance to that 'newtype' with the module \"Foreign.Storable.Newtype\". "
"This way you do not need the 'GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving' feature of GHC. \n"
"* If you have a type that is an instance of 'Traversable', you can use that "
"feature for implementation of 'Storable' methods. The module \"Foreign."
"Storable.Traversable\" allows manipulation of the portion of your type, that "
"is accessible by 'Traversable' methods. For instance with the type 'data T a "
"= Cons Int [a]' and an according 'Traversable' implementation, you can load "
"and store the elements of the contained list. This may be part of a "
"'Storable' implementation of the whole type. \n"
"* If you have a record containing elements of various types, then you need "
"module \"Foreign.Storable.Record\".\n"
"\n"
"Note however that the Storable instances defined with this package are quite "
"slow in (up to) GHC-6.12.1. I'm afraid this is due to incomplete inlining, "
"but we have still to investigate the problem.\n"

"This package contains two modules, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/"
"streaming/docs/Streaming.html Streaming> and <http://hackage.haskell.org/"
"package/streaming/docs/Streaming-Prelude.html Streaming.Prelude>. The "
"principal module, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-0.1.4.3/docs/"
"Streaming-Prelude.html Streaming.Prelude>, exports an elementary streaming "
"prelude focused on a simple \"source\" or \"producer\" type, namely 'Stream "
"(Of a) m r'. This is a sort of effectful version of '([a],r)' in which "
"successive elements of type 'a' arise from some sort of monadic action "
"before the succession ends with a value of type 'r'. Everything in the "
"library is organized to make programming with this type as simple as "
"possible, by the simple expedient of making it as close to 'Prelude' and "
"'Data.List' as possible. Thus for example the trivial program\n"
"\n"
"> >>> S.sum $ S.take 3 (S.readLn :: Stream (Of Int) IO ()) > 1<Enter> > "
"2<Enter> > 3<Enter> > 6 :> ()\n"
"\n"
"sums the first three valid integers from user input. Similarly,\n"
"\n"
"> >>> S.stdoutLn $ S.map (map toUpper) $ S.take 2 S.stdinLn > hello<Enter> > "
"HELLO > world!<Enter> > WORLD!\n"
"\n"
"upper-cases the first two lines from stdin as they arise, and sends them to "
"stdout. And so on, with filtering, mapping, breaking, chunking, zipping, "
"unzipping, replicating and so forth: we program with streams of 'Int's or "
"'String's directly as if they constituted something like a list. That's "
"because streams really do constitute something like a list, and the "
"associated operations can mostly have the same names. (A few, like "
"'reverse', don't stream and thus disappear; others like 'unzip' are here "
"given properly streaming formulation for the first time.) And we everywhere "
"oppose \"extracting a pure list from IO\", which is the origin of typical "
"Haskell memory catastrophes. Basically any case where you are tempted to use "
"'mapM', 'replicateM', 'traverse' or 'sequence' with Haskell lists, you would "
"do better to use something like 'Stream (Of a) m r'. The type signatures are "
"a little fancier, but the programs themselves are mostly the same. /In fact, "
"they are mostly simpler./ Thus, consider the trivial demo program mentioned "
"in <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24068399/haskell-performance-of-"
"iorefs this SO question>\n"
"\n"
"> main = mapM newIORef [1..10^8::Int] >>= mapM readIORef >>= mapM_ print\n"
"\n"
"The new user notices that this exhausts memory, and worries about the "
"efficiency of Haskell 'IORefs'. But of course it exhausts memory! Look what "
"it says! The problem is immediately cured by writing\n"
"\n"
"> main = S.print $ S.mapM readIORef $ S.mapM newIORef $ S.each [1..10^8::"
"Int]\n"
"\n"
"which really does what the other program was meant to do, uses no more "
"memory than 'hello-world', /and is simpler anyway/, since it doesn't involve "
"the detour of \"extracting a list from IO\". Almost every use of list "
"'mapM', 'replicateM', 'traverse' and 'sequence' produces this problem on a "
"smaller scale. People get used to it, as if it were characteristic of "
"Haskell programs to use a lot of memory. But in truth \"extracting a list or "
"sequence from IO\" is mostly just bad practice pure and simple. Of course, "
"'mapM', 'replicateM', 'traverse' and 'sequence' make sense for lists, under "
"certain conditions! But 'unsafePerformIO' also makes sense under certain "
"conditions.\n"
"\n"
"The <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-0.1.4.3/docs/Streaming."
"html Streaming> module exports the general type, 'Stream f m r', which can "
"be used to stream successive distinct steps characterized by /any/ functor "
"'f', though we are mostly interested in organizing computations of the form "
"'Stream (Of a) m r'. The streaming-IO libraries have various devices for "
"dealing with effectful variants of '[a]' or '([a],r)' in which the emergence "
"of successive elements somehow depends on IO. But it is only with the "
"general type 'Stream f m r', or some equivalent, that one can envisage (for "
"example) the connected streaming of their sorts of stream - as one makes "
"lists of lists in the Haskell 'Prelude' and 'Data.List'. One needs some such "
"type if we are to express properly streaming equivalents of e.g.\n"
"\n"
"> group :: Ord a => [a] -> [[a]] > chunksOf :: Int -> [a] -> [[a]] > "
"lines :: [Char] -> [[Char]] -- but similarly with byte streams, etc.\n"
"\n"
"to mention a few obviously desirable operations. (This is explained more "
"elaborately in the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming#readme "
"readme> below.)\n"
"\n"
"One could throw of course throw something like the present 'Stream' type on "
"top of a prior stream concept: this is how 'pipes' and 'pipes-group' (which "
"are very much our model here) use 'FreeT'. But once one grasps the iterable "
"stream concept needed to express those functions then one will also see "
"that, with it, one is /already/ in possession of a complete elementary "
"streaming library - since one possesses 'Stream ((,) a) m r' or equivalently "
"'Stream (Of a) m r'. This is the type of a 'generator' or 'producer' or "
"'source' or whatever you call an effectful stream of items. /The present "
"Streaming.Prelude is thus the simplest streaming library that can replicate "
"anything like the API of the Prelude and Data.List/.\n"
"\n"
"The emphasis of the library is on interoperation; for the rest its "
"advantages are: extreme simplicity, re-use of intuitions the user has "
"gathered from mastery of 'Prelude' and 'Data.List', and a total and "
"systematic rejection of type synonyms. The two conceptual pre-requisites are "
"some comprehension of monad transformers and some familiarity with 'rank 2 "
"types'. It is hoped that experimentation with this simple material, starting "
"with the ghci examples in 'Streaming.Prelude', will give people who are new "
"to these concepts some intuition about their importance. The most "
"fundamental purpose of the library is to express elementary streaming ideas "
"without reliance on a complex framework, but in a way that integrates "
"transparently with the rest of Haskell, using ideas - e.g. rank 2 types, "
"which are here implicit or explicit in most mapping - that the user can "
"carry elsewhere, rather than chaining her understanding to the curiosities "
"of a so-called streaming IO framework (as necessary as that is for certain "
"purposes.)\n"
"\n"
"See the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming#readme readme> below "
"for further explanation, including the examples linked there. Elementary "
"usage can be divined from the ghci examples in 'Streaming.Prelude' and "
"perhaps from this rough beginning of a <https://github.com/michaelt/"
"streaming-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.md tutorial>. Note also the <https://"
"hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-bytestring streaming bytestring> and "
"<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-utils streaming utils> "
"packages. Questions about usage can be put raised on StackOverflow with the "
"tag '[haskell-streaming]', or as an issue on Github, or on the <https://"
"groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskell-pipes pipes list> (the package "
"understands itself as part of the pipes 'ecosystem'.)\n"
"\n"
"The simplest form of interoperation with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/"
"pipes pipes> is accomplished with this isomorphism:\n"
"\n"
"> Pipes.unfoldr Streaming.next :: Stream (Of a) m r -> Producer a m r > "
"Streaming.unfoldr Pipes.next :: Producer a m r -> Stream (Of a) m r\n"
"\n"
"Interoperation with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams io-"

"\n"
"> Streaming.reread IOStreams.read :: InputStream a -> Stream (Of a) IO () > "
"IOStreams.unfoldM Streaming.uncons :: Stream (Of a) IO () -> IO (InputStream "
"a)\n"
"\n"
"With <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit conduit> one might use, e."
"g.:\n"
"\n"
"> Conduit.unfoldM Streaming.uncons :: Stream (Of a) m () -> Source m a > str "
"-> Streaming.mapM_ Conduit.yield (hoist lift str) :: Stream (Of o) m r -> "
"ConduitM i o m r > src -> hoist lift str $$ Conduit.mapM_ Streaming.yield :: "
"Source m a\n"
"-> Stream (Of a) m ()\n"
"\n"
"These conversions should never be more expensive than a single '>->' or '="
"$='. The simplest interoperation with regular Haskell lists is provided by, "
"say\n"
"\n"
"> Streaming.each :: [a] -> Stream (Of a) m () > Streaming.toList_ :: Stream "
"(Of a) m r -> m [a]\n"
"\n"
"The latter of course accumulates the whole list in memory, and is mostly "
"what we are trying to avoid. Every use of 'Prelude.mapM f' should be "
"reconceived as using the composition 'Streaming.toList_ . Streaming.mapM f . "
"Streaming.each' with a view to considering whether the accumulation required "

"This is an implementation of effectful, memory-constrained bytestrings (byte "

"non-lazy-io.\n"
"\n"
"The implementation follows the details of 'Data.ByteString.Lazy' and 'Data."
"ByteString.Lazy.Char8' in unrelenting detail, omitting only transparently "
"non-streaming operations like 'reverse'. It is just a question of replacing "
"the lazy bytestring type:\n"
"\n"
"> data ByteString = Empty | Chunk Strict.ByteString ByteString\n"
"\n"
"with the /minimal/ effectful variant:\n"
"\n"
"> data ByteString m r = Empty r | Chunk Strict.ByteString (ByteString m r) | "
"Go (m (ByteString m r))\n"
"\n"
"(Constructors are necessarily hidden in internal modules in both the 'Lazy' "
"and the 'Streaming'.)\n"
"\n"
"That's it. As a lazy bytestring is implemented internally by a sort of list "
"of strict bytestring chunks, a streaming bytestring is simply implemented as "
"a /producer/ or /generator/ of strict bytestring chunks. Most operations are "
"defined by simply adding a line to what we find in 'Data.ByteString.Lazy'.\n"
"\n"
"Something like this alteration of type is of course obvious and mechanical, "
"once the idea of an effectful bytestring type is contemplated and lazy io is "
"rejected. Indeed it seems that this is the proper expression of what was "
"intended by lazy bytestrings to begin with. The documentation, after all, "
"reads \n"
"* \"A key feature of lazy ByteStrings is the means to manipulate large or "
"unbounded streams of data without requiring the entire sequence to be "
"resident in memory. To take advantage of this you have to write your "
"functions in a lazy streaming style, e.g. classic pipeline composition. The "
"default I/O chunk size is 32k, which should be good in most circumstances."
"\"\n"
"\n"
"... which is very much the idea of this library: the default chunk size for "
"'hGetContents' and the like follows 'Data.ByteString.Lazy'; operations like "
"'lines' and 'append' and so on are tailored not to increase chunk size.\n"
"\n"
"The present library is thus nothing but /lazy bytestring done right/. The "
"authors of 'Data.ByteString.Lazy' must have supposed that the directly "
"monadic formulation of such their type would necessarily make things slower. "
"This appears to be a prejudice. For example, passing a large file of short "
"lines through this benchmark transformation\n"
"\n"
"> Lazy.unlines . map (bs -> \"!\" <> Lazy.drop 5 bs) . Lazy.lines > "

"meaning almost exactly what we mean above, but with results like this\n"
"\n"
"> time ./benchlines pipes >> /dev/null > real 0m6.353s\n"

"\n"
"These concepts belong to the ABCs of streaming; 'lines' is just a textbook "

"But the concepts are /catastrophically mishandled/ in /all/ streaming io "

"It is common knowledge that lazy datastructures can lead to space-leaks. "
"This problem is particularly prominent, when using lazy datastructures to "
"store the state of a long-running application in memory. The easiest "
"solution to this problem is to use fully strict types to store such state "
"values. By \"fully strict types\" we mean types for whose values it holds "
"that, if they are in weak-head normal form, then they are also in normal "
"form. Intuitively, this means that values of fully strict types cannot "
"contain unevaluated thunks.\n"
"\n"
"To define a fully strict datatype, one typically uses the following recipe.\n"
"\n"
"1. Make all fields of every constructor strict; i.e., add a bang to all "
"fields.\n"
"\n"
"2. Use only strict types for the fields of the constructors.\n"
"\n"
"The second requirement is problematic as it rules out the use of the "
"standard Haskell 'Maybe', 'Either', and pair types. This library solves this "
"problem by providing strict variants of these types and their corresponding "
"standard support functions and type-class instances.\n"
"\n"
"Note that this library does currently not provide fully strict lists. They "
"can be added if they are really required. However, in many cases one "
"probably wants to use unboxed or strict boxed vectors from the 'vector' "
"library (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector>) instead of strict "
"lists. Moreover, instead of 'String's one probably wants to use strict "
"'Text' values from the 'text' library (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/"
"text>).\n"
"\n"
"This library comes with batteries included; i.e., missing instances for type-"
"classes from the 'deepseq', 'binary', 'aeson', 'QuickCheck', and 'lens' "
"packages are included. Of particluar interest is the 'Strict' type-class "
"provided by the lens library (<http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/"
"lens/3.9.0.2/doc/html/Control-Lens-Iso.html#t:Strict>). It is used in the "
"following example to simplify the modification of strict fields.\n"

"'turtle' is a reimplementation of the Unix command line environment in "
"Haskell so that you can use Haskell as both a shell and a scripting "
"language.\n"
"\n"
"Features include: \n"
"* Batteries included: Command an extended suite of predefined utilities \n"
"* Interoperability: You can still run external shell commands \n"
"* Portability: Works on Windows, OS X, and Linux \n"
"* Exception safety: Safely acquire and release resources \n"
"* Streaming: Transform or fold command output in constant space \n"
"* Patterns: Use typed regular expressions that can parse structured values \n"
"* Formatting: Type-safe 'printf'-style text formatting \n"
"* Modern: Supports 'text' and 'system-filepath'\n"
"\n"
"Read \"Turtle.Tutorial\" for a detailed tutorial or \"Turtle.Prelude\" for a "
"quick-start guide\n"
"\n"
"'turtle' is designed to be beginner-friendly, but as a result lacks certain "
"features, like tracing commands. If you feel comfortable using 'turtle' then "
"you should also check out the 'Shelly' library which provides similar "
