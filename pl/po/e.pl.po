"Enblend is a tool for compositing images using a Burt & Adelson "

"blended across a transition zone, proportional in size to the spatial "
"frequency of the features. For example, objects like trees and window panes "
"have rapid changes in color. By blending these features in a narrow zone, "
"you cannot see the seam because the eye already expects to see color changes "
"at the edge of these features. Clouds and sky are the opposite. These "
"features must be blended across a wide transition zone because any sudden "
