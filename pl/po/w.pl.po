"Window Maker is an X11 window manager originally designed to provide "
"integration support for the GNUstep Desktop Environment. In every way "
"possible, it reproduces the elegant look and feel of the NEXTSTEP user "
"interface. It is fast, feature rich, easy to configure, and easy to use. It "
"is also free software, with contributions being made by programmers from "
"around the world.\n"
"\n"
"Window Maker has a stable user interface since many years and comes with a "
"powerful GUI configuration editor called WPrefs, which removes the need to "
"edit text-based config files by hand. It supports running dockapps which "
"make everyday tasks such as monitoring system performance and battery usage, "
"mounting devices or connecting to the internet very easy. Please see the "
"features section for more specifics on what Window Maker can do, and how it "
"compares with other popular window managers."

"WavPack is a completely open audio compression format providing lossless, "

"4 format has been designed from the ground up to offer unparalleled "
"performance and functionality.\n"
"\n"
"In the default lossless mode WavPack acts just like a WinZip compressor for "

"quality, not a single bit of the original information is lost, so there's no "
"chance of degradation. This makes lossless mode ideal for archiving audio "
"material or any other situation where quality is paramount. The compression "
"ratio depends on the source material, but generally is between 30% and 70%.\n"
"\n"
"The hybrid mode provides all the advantages of lossless compression with an "
"additional bonus. Instead of creating a single file, this mode creates both "
"a relatively small, high-quality lossy file that can be used all by itself, "
"and a \"correction\" file that (when combined with the lossy file) provides "
"full lossless restoration. For some users this means never having to choose "
"between lossless and lossy compression!"

"The hybrid mode provides all the advantages of lossless compression with an "

"a relatively small, high-quality lossy file that can be used all by itself, "
"and a \"correction\" file that (when combined with the lossy file) provides "
