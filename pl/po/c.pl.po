"thousands of mail accounts. With its built-in IMAP and POP3 aggregation "
"proxy, Courier-IMAP has practically infinite horizontal scalability. In a "
"proxy configuration, a pool of Courier servers service initial IMAP and POP3 "
"connections from clients. They wait to receive the client's log in request, "
"look up the server that actually holds this mail account's mailbox, and "
"establish a proxy connection to the server, all in a single, seamless "
"process. Mail accounts can be moved between different servers, to achieve "
"optimum resource usage.\n"
"\n"
"The only practical limitation on Courier-IMAP is available network and I/O "
"bandwidth. If you are new to Courier-IMAP, this may sound a bit "
"intimidating. But you do not need to tackle everything at once. Start by "
"taking small, easy steps. Your first step will be to set up a small Courier-"
"IMAP server, using it like any other traditional IMAP service, on a single "
"server. After you gain experience and become comfortable with Courier, you "
"can then begin exploring its advanced features.\n"
"\n"
"This is the same IMAP server that's included in the Courier mail server, but "
"configured as a standalone IMAP server that can be used with other mail "
"servers - such as Qmail, Exim, or Postfix - that deliver to maildirs. If you "
"already have Courier installed, you do not need to download this version. If "
"you install this version, you must remove it if you later install the entire "
"Courier server."
