"\"PhysicsFS is a library to provide abstract access to various archives. It "
"is intended for use in video games, and the design was somewhat inspired by "
"Quake 3's file subsystem. The programmer defines a \"write directory\" on "
"the physical filesystem. No file writing done through the PhysicsFS API can "
"leave that write directory, for security. For example, an embedded scripting "
"language cannot write outside of this path if it uses PhysFS for all of its "
"I/O, which means that untrusted scripts can run more safely. Symbolic links "
"can be disabled as well, for added safety. For file reading, the programmer "
"lists directories and archives that form a \"search path\". Once the search "
"path is defined, it becomes a single, transparent hierarchical filesystem. "
"This makes for easy access to ZIP files in the same way as you access a file "
"directly on the disk, and it makes it easy to ship a new archive that will "
"override a previous archive on a per-file basis. Finally, PhysicsFS gives "
"you platform-abstracted means to determine if CD-ROMs are available, the "
"user's home directory, where in the real filesystem your program is running, "
"etc.\""
