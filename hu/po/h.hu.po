"The HepMC package is an object oriented event record written in C++ for High "
"Energy Physics Monte Carlo Generators. Many extensions from HEPEVT, the "
"Fortran HEP standard, are supported: the number of entries is unlimited, "
"spin density matrices can be stored with each vertex, flow patterns (such as "
"color) can be stored and traced, integers representing random number "
"generator states can be stored, and an arbitrary number of event weights can "
"be included. Particles and vertices are kept separate in a graph structure, "
"physically similar to a physics event. The added information supports the "
"modularisation of event generators. The package has been kept as simple as "
"possible with minimal internal/external dependencies. Event information is "
