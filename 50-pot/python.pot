Another advantage of this over traditional completion schemes where the completion strings are hard-coded in a separate bash source file, is that the same code that parses the options is used to generate the completions, so the completions is always up-to-date with the program itself.\n"

It draws the line at context-free character-by-character mapping. So a good rule of thumb is that the further the script you are transliterating is from Latin alphabet, the worse the transliteration will be.\n"
"\n"
"Note that this module generally produces better results than simply stripping accents from characters (which can be done in Python with built-in functions). It is based on hand-tuned character mappings that for example also contain ASCII approximations for symbols and non-Latin alphabets.\n"

"- ``Streamix`` mixer for iterables given their starting time deltas;\n"
"- Multi-thread audio I/O integration with PyAudio;\n"
"- Linear filtering with Z-transform filters directly as equations (e.g.   ``filt = 1 / (1 - .3 * z ** -1)``), including linear time variant filters   (i.e., the ``a`` in ``a * z ** k`` can be a Stream instance), cascade   filters (behaves as a list of filters), resonators, etc.. Each   ``LinearFilter`` instance is compiled just in time when called;\n"
"- Zeros and poles plots and frequency response plotting integration with   MatPlotLib;\n"
"- Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) directly to ``ZFilter`` instances, from   which you can find PARCOR coeffs and LSFs;\n"
"- Both sample-based (e.g., zero-cross rate, envelope, moving average,   clipping, unwrapping) and block-based (e.g., window functions, DFT,   autocorrelation, lag matrix) analysis and processing tools;\n"
"- A simple synthesizer (Table lookup, Karplus-Strong) with processing tools   (Linear ADSR envelope, fade in/out, fixed duration line stream) and basic   wave data generation (sinusoid, white noise, impulse);\n"
"- Biological auditory periphery modeling (ERB and gammatone filter models);\n"
"- Multiple implementation organization as ``StrategyDict`` instances:   callable dictionaries that allows the same name to have several different   implementations (e.g. ``erb``, ``gammatone``, ``lowpass``, ``resonator``,   ``lpc``, ``window``);\n"

"* Works great with standard Python string formatting.\n"
"* Provides up-to-the-moment terminal height and width, so you can respond to   terminal size changes.\n"
"* Avoids making a mess if the output gets piped to a non-terminal:   outputs to any file-like object such as *StringIO*, files, or pipes.\n"
"* Uses the `terminfo(5)`_ database so it works with any terminal type   and supports any terminal capability: No more C-like calls to tigetstr_   and tparm_.\n"
"* Keeps a minimum of internal state, so you can feel free to mix and match with   calls to curses or whatever other terminal libraries you like.\n"
"* Provides plenty of context managers to safely express terminal modes,   automatically restoring the terminal to a safe state on exit.\n"
"* Act intelligently when somebody redirects your output to a file, omitting   all of the terminal sequences such as styling, colors, or positioning.\n"
"* Dead-simple keyboard handling: safely decoding unicode input in your   system's preferred locale and supports application/arrow keys.\n"
"* Allows the printable length of strings containing sequences to be   determined.\n"

"* Windows command prompt support.  A PDCurses_ build of python for windows   provides only partial support at this time -- there are plans to merge with   the ansi module in concert with colorama to resolve this."

msgid "The `coloredlogs` package enables colored terminal output for Python's logging_ module. The ColoredFormatter_ class inherits from `logging.Formatter`_ and uses `ANSI escape sequences`_ to render your logging messages in color. It uses only standard colors so it should work on any UNIX terminal. It's currently tested on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and PyPy. On Windows `coloredlogs` automatically pulls in Colorama_ as a dependency and enables ANSI escape sequence translation using Colorama."

"pyinotify relies on a recent Linux Kernel feature (merged in kernel 2.6.13) called inotify. inotify is an event-driven notifier, its notifications are exported from kernel space to user space. The raw interface of inotify is compounded of three system calls. pyinotify binds these system calls and provides an implementation on top of them offering a generic and abstract way to use inotify with Python. Pyinotify doesn't requires much detailed knowledge of inotify. Moreover, it only needs few statements for initializing, watching, handling (eventually trough a new separate thread), and processing events notifications through subclassing. The only things to know is the path of items to watch, the kind of events to monitor and the actions to execute on these notifications."

"The pyprimes package offers a variety of algorithms for generating prime numbers and fast primality tests, written in pure Python.\n"
"\n"
"Prime numbers are those positive integers which are not divisible exactly by any number other than itself or one. Generating primes and testing for primality has been a favourite mathematical pastime for centuries, as well as of great practical importance for encrypting data.\n"
"\n"
"``pyprimes`` includes the following features:\n"
"\n"
"    - Produce prime numbers lazily, on demand.     - Effective algorithms including Sieve of Eratosthenes, Croft Spiral,       and Wheel Factorisation.     - Efficiently test whether numbers are prime, using both deterministic       (exact) and probabilistic primality tests.     - Examples of what *not* to do are provided, including naive trial       division, Turner's algorithm, and primality testing using a       regular expression.     - Factorise small numbers into the product of prime factors.     - Suitable for Python 2.4 through 3.x from one code base."

"Scspell is a spell checker for source code. This is an unofficial fork (of https://launchpad.net/scspell) that runs on both Python 2 and 3.\n"
"\n"
"Scspell does not try to be particularly smart--rather, it does the simplest thing that can possibly work:\n"
"\n"
"    1. All alphanumeric strings (strings of letters, numbers, and        underscores) are spell-checked tokens.     2. Each token is split into one or more subtokens. Underscores and digits        always divide tokens, and capital letters will begin new subtokens. In        other words, ``some_variable`` and ``someVariable`` will both generate        the subtoken list {``some``, ``variable``}.     3. All subtokens longer than three characters are matched against a set of        dictionaries, and a match failure prompts the user for action. When        matching against the included English dictionary, *prefix matching* is        employed; this choice permits the use of truncated words like ``dict``        as valid subtokens.\n"
"\n"
"When applied to code written in most popular programming languages while using typical naming conventions, this algorithm will usually catch many errors without an annoying false positive rate.\n"
"\n"
"In an effort to catch more spelling errors, Scspell is able to check each file against a set of dictionary words selected *specifically for that file*. Up to three different sub-dictionaries may be searched for any given file:\n"
"\n"
"    1. A natural language dictionary. (Scspell provides an American        English dictionary as the default.)     2. A programming language-specific dictionary, intended to contain        oddly-spelled keywords and APIs associated with that language.        (Scspell provides small default dictionaries for a number of popular        programming languages.)     3.

"* nested commands made easy: no messing with subparsers (though they are of   course used under the hood);\n"
"* infer agrument type from the default value;\n"

Dictionaries and sequences will be diffed recursively, when applicable. It has special-case handling for multi-line strings, showing them as a typical unified diff. Drop-in replacements for some nose assertions are available.  If the assertion fails, a nice data diff is shown, letting you easily pinpoint the root difference."

"Traditional visualization systems treat plotting as a unitary process transforming incoming data into an onscreen or printed image, with parameters that can be specified beforehand that affect the final result.  While this approach works for small collections of data that can be viewed in their entirety, the visualization for large datasets is often the only way to understand what the data consists of, and there is no objective way to set the parameters to reveal this data.\n"
"\n"
"The datashader library breaks up the rendering pipeline into a series of stages where user-defined computations can be performed, allowing the visualization to adapt to and reveal the underlying properties of the dataset, i.e. the datashader pipeline allows computation *on the visualization*, not just on the dataset, allowing it to do automatic ranging and scaling that takes the current visualization constraints into account.  For instance, where a traditional system would use a transparency/opacity parameter to show the density of overlapping points in a scatterplot, datashader can automatically calculate how many datapoints are mapped to each pixel, scaling the representation to accurately convey the data at every location, with no saturation, overplotting, or underplotting issues."

"django-pglocks provides a useful context manager to manage PostgreSQL advisory locks. It requires Django (tested with 1.5), PostgreSQL, and (probably) psycopg2.\n"
"\n"
"Advisory locks are application-level locks that are acquired and released purely by the client of the database; PostgreSQL never acquires them on its own. They are very useful as a way of signalling to other sessions that a higher-level resource than a single row is in use, without having to lock an entire table or some other structure.\n"
"\n"
"It's entirely up to the application to correctly acquire the right lock.\n"
"\n"
"Advisory locks are either session locks or transaction locks. A session lock is held until the database session disconnects (or is reset); a transaction lock is held until the transaction terminates.\n"
"\n"
"Currently, the context manager only creates session locks, as the behavior of a lock persisting after the context body has been exited is surprising, and there's no way of releasing a transaction-scope advisory lock except to exit the transaction."

This also works with      things like doctests.    * Resets random.seed() at the start of every test case and test to      fixed number - this defaults to time.time() from the start of      your test run, but you can pass in --randomly-seed to repeat a      randomness-induced failure.    * If factory boy is installed, its random state is reset at the      start of every test. This allows for repeatable use of its random      'fuzzy' features.    * If faker is installed, its random state is reset at the start of      every test.
