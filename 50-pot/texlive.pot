"After installing texlive and the package texlive-latex, find a large selection of documentation for TeX, LaTeX, and various layout styles in /usr/share/texmf/doc.\n"
"\n"
"TeX (pronounced tech) is an interpreter for text formatting and was developed by Donald E. Knuth.  It works with control and macro commands on a text file. Working with TeX is similar to typesetting methods. LaTeX is a complex macro package that removes the cryptical TeX interface and does most of the work for the user.\n"
"\n"
"TeX uses special fonts produced by the MetaFont program. Various printer drivers and an X11 viewer are also included in this package. The teTeX package is based on the standard TeX package of Karl Berry, which makes configuration much easier. It is also possible to use PostScript fonts. A real PostScript printer is required, however. If the ghostscript (gs) package is installed, all drivers for printing and viewing can use these fonts. Note, however, that the fonts included in the ghostscript package are not identical to Adobe's PostScript fonts. The copyright prohibids us to include them on the CD.\n"
"\n"
"Besides these features, the programs MakeIndex (for producing indexes) and BibTeX (for literature data processing) exist.\n"
"\n"
"The texlive package includes a full texmf tree, many programs like tex, dvips, etc., shell script configuration, and a big collection of documentations. This package is easily configured by the script texconfig and has multilanguage options."

#. leap/texlive-biblatex/description
msgid ""
"Biblatex is a complete reimplementation of the bibliographic facilities provided by LaTeX in conjunction with BibTeX. It redesigns the way in which LaTeX interacts with BibTeX at a fairly fundamental level. With biblatex, BibTeX is only used (if it is used at all) to sort the bibliography and to generate labels. Formatting of the bibliography is entirely controlled by TeX macros (the BibTeX-based mechanism embeds some parts of formatting in the BibTeX style file. Good working knowledge in LaTeX should be sufficient to design new bibliography and citation styles; nothing related to BibTeX's language is needed. In fact, users need not remain bound to BibTeX for use with biblatex: an alternative bibliography processor biblatex- biber is available. Development of biblatex and biblatex-biber is closely coupled; the present release of biblatex is designed to work with biblatex-biber version 0.9.6. The package needs e- TeX, and uses the author's etoolbox and logreq packages. For users of biblatex-biber, version 0.9 is required (at least; refer to the notes for the version of biblatex-biber that you are using). Apart from the features unique to biblatex, the package also incorporates core features of the following packages: babelbib, bibtopic, bibunits, chapterbib, cite, inlinebib, mcite and mciteplus, mlbib, multibib, splitbib. Biblatex supports split bibliographies and multiple bibliographies within one document, and separate lists of bibliographic shorthands. Bibliographies may be subdivided into parts (by chapter, by section, etc.) and/or segmented by topics (by type, by keyword, etc.). Biblatex is fully localized and can interface with the babel.\n"

"The Cyclop typeface was designed in the 1920s at the workshop of Warsaw type foundry \"Odlewnia Czcionek J. Idzkowski i S-ka\". This sans serif typeface has a highly modulated stroke so it has high typographic contrast. The vertical stems are much heavier then horizontal ones. Most characters have thin rectangles as additional counters giving the unique shape of the characters. The lead types of Cyclop typeface were produced in slanted variant at sizes 8-48 pt. It was heavily used for heads in newspapers and accidents prints. Typesetters used Cyclop in the inter-war period, during the occupation in the underground press. The typeface was used until the beginnings of the offset print and computer typesetting era. Nowadays it is hard to find the metal types of this typeface. The font was generated using the Metatype1 package. Then the original set of characters was completed by adding the full set of accented letters and characters of the modern Latin alphabets (including Vietnamese). The upright variant was generated and it was more complicated task than it appeared at the beginning. 11 upright letters of the Cyclop typeface were presented in the book by Filip Trzaska, \"Podstawy techniki wydawniczej\" (\"Foundation of the publishing techonology\"), Warsaw 1967. But even the author of the book does not know what was the source of the presented examples. The fonts are distributed in the Type1 and OpenType formats along with the files necessary for use these fonts in TeX and LaTeX including encoding definition files: T1 (ec), T5 (Vietnamese), OT4, QX, texnansi and nonstandard ones (IL2 for Czech fonts).\n"

The main particle name is a Roman or Greek symbol, to be typeset in upright font in normal contexts. 2. Additionally a superscript and/or subscript may follow the main symbol. 3. Particle resonances may also have a resonance specifier which is typeset in parentheses following the main symbol. In general the parentheses may also be followed by sub- and superscripts. 4. The particle names are expected to be used both in and out of mathematical contexts. 5. If the surrounding text is bold or italic then the particle name should adapt to that context as best as possible (this may not be possible for Greek symbols). A consequence of point 5 is that the well-known problems with boldness of particle names in section titles, headers and tables of contents automatically disappear if these macros are used.\n"

The metadata is designed to be easy to extract, even by programs that are oblivious to the document's file format. Most of Adobe's applications store XMP metadata when saving files. Now, with the hyperxmp package, it is trivial for LaTeX document authors to store XMP metadata in their documents as well. Version 2.2 of the package added support for the IPTC Photo Metadata schema. It allows \\xmpcomma and \\xmpquote to be used in any hyperxmp option, not only those that require special treatment of commas. And it introduces an \\xmplinesep macro that controls how multiline fields are represented in the XMP packet. The package integrates seamlessly with hyperref and requires virtually no modifications to documents that already exploit hyperref's mechanisms for specifying PDF metadata. The current version of hyperxmp can embed the following metadata as XMP: title, authors, primary author's title or position, metadata writer, subject/summary, keywords, copyright, license URL, document base URL, document identifier and instance identifier, language, source file name, PDF generating tool, PDF version, and contact telephone number/postal address/email address/URL. Hyperxmp currently embeds XMP only within PDF documents; it is compatible with pdflatex, xelatex, latex+dvipdfm, and latex+dvips+ps2pdf.\n"

This may be useful, for example, if you have a large table and want to include it in texts with different output conventions without the need to change the table. The package can also automatically group digits left of the decimal separator (thousands) and right of the decimal separator (thousandths) in triplets without the need of specifing commas (English) or points (German) as separators. E.g., the input $1234.567890$ can be output as $1\\,234.\\,567\\,890$. Finally, an e starts the exponent of the number. For example, $21e6$ may be output as $26\\times10\\,^{6}$.\n"

The class automatically loads an associated patch file mempatch; the patch file may be updated from time to time, between releases of the class itself. (The patch file stays around even when there are no extant patches.) Users who wish to use the hyperref package, in a document written with the memoir class, should also use the memhfixc package (part of this bundle). Note, however, that current versions of hyperref actually load the package automatically if they detect that they are running under memoir.\n"

Metaplot also includes a very flexible set of macros for generating plot axes, which may be useful in other contexts as well. Presently, MetaPlot is in something of a pre-release beta state; it is quite functional, but the syntax of the commands are still potentially in flux.

Component parts of the bundle are: breqn, empheq, flexisym, mathstyle and mathtools, mhsetup, The empheq package is a visual markup extension of amsmath. Empheq allows sophisticated boxing and other marking of multi-line maths displays, and fixes problems with the way that the ntheorem package places end-of-theorem markers. The mathtools package provides many useful tools for mathematical typesetting. It fixes various deficiencies of amsmath and standard LaTeX. The mhsetup package defines various programming tools needed by both empheq and mathtools. The breqn package makes more easy the business of preparing displayed equations in LaTeX, including permitting automatic line-breaking within displayed equations. (Breqn uses the mathstyle package to keep track of the current maths typesetting style, something that raw TeX hides from the programmer.)\n"

These features may be applied to customisable sets of fonts, and all micro- typographic aspects of the fonts can be configured in a straight-forward and flexible way.

"MonTeX provides Mongolian and Manju support for the TeX/LaTeX community. Mongolian is a language spoken in North East Asia, namely Mongolia and the Inner Mongol Autonomous Region of China. Today, it is written in an extended Cyrillic alphabet in Mongolia whereas the Uighur writing continues to be in use in Inner Mongolia, though it is also, legally speaking, the official writing system of Mongolia. Manju is another language of North East Asia, belonging to the Tungusic branch of the Altaic languages. Though it is hardly spoken nowadays, it survives in written form as Manju was the native language of the rulers of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) in China. Large quantities of documents of the Imperial Archives survive, as well as some of the finest dictionaries ever compiled in Asia, like the Pentaglot, a dictionary comprising Manju, Tibetan, Mongolian, Uighur and Chinese. MonTeX provides all necessary characters for writing standard Mongolian in Cyrillic and Classical (aka Traditional or Uighur) writing, and Manju as well as transliterated Tibetan texts, for which purpose a number of additional characters was created. In MonTeX, both Mongolian and Manju are entered in romanized form. The retransliteration (from Latin input to Mongolian and Manju output) is completely realized in TeX/Metafont so that no external preprocessor is required. Please note that most of the enhanced functions of MonTeX require a working e-LaTeX environment. This is especially true when compiling documents with Mongolian or Manju as the main document language. It is recommended to choose pdfelatex as the resulting PDF files are truly portable. Vertical text generated by MonTeX is not supported in DVI.\n"

"Old Standard is designed to reproduce the actual printing style of the early 20th century, reviving a specific type of Modern (classicist) style of serif typefaces, very commonly used in various editions of the late 19th and early 20th century, but almost completely abandoned later. The font supports typesetting of Old and Middle English, Old Icelandic, Cyrillic (with historical characters, extensions for Old Slavonic and localised forms), Gothic transliterations, critical editions of Classical Greek and Latin, and many more. Old Standard works with TeX engines that directly support OpenType features, such as XeTeX and LuaTeX.\n"

Also provided is a switch to generate a PerlTeX-free, document- specific, noperltex.sty that is useful when distributing a document to places where PerlTeX is not available.\n"

"The package contains the Antykwa Poltawskiego family of fonts in the PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats. The original font was designed in the twenties of the XX century by the Polish typographer Adam Poltawski(1881-1952). Following the route set out by the Latin Modern and TeX Gyre projects (http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry), the Antykwa Poltawskiego digitisation project aims at providing a rich collection of diacritical characters in the attempt to cover as many Latin-based scripts as possible. To our knowledge, the repertoire of characters covers all European languages as well as some other Latin-based alphabets such as Vietnamese and Navajo; at the request of users, recent extensions (following the enhancement of the Latin Modern collection) provide glyphs sufficient for typesetting of romanized transliterations of Arabic and Sanskrit scripts. The Antykwa Poltawskiego family consists of 4 weights (light, normal, medium, bold), each having upright and italic forms and one of 5 design sizes: 6, 8, 10, 12 and 17pt (in the OTF lingo: extended, semiextended, normal, semicondensed, and condensed, respectively). Altogether, the collection comprises 40 font files, containing the same repertoire of 1126 characters. The preliminary version of Antykwa Poltawskiego (antp package) released in 2000 is rendered obsolete by this package.\n"

The package is supplied with a (unix) shell file for a 'pslatex' command that allows standard LaTeX documents to be processed, without needing to edit the file.

Note that while many of the fonts are available in PostScript (and other) printers, most publishers require fonts embedded in documents, which requires that you have the fonts in your TeX system. Fortunately, there are free versions of the fonts from URW (available in the URW base5 bundle). The base set of text fonts covered by PSNFSS are: AvantGarde, Bookman, Courier, Helvetica, New Century Schoolbook, Palatino, Symbol, Times Roman and Zapf Dingbats. In addition, the fonts Bitstream Charter and Adobe Utopia are covered (those fonts were contributed to the Public Domain by their commercial foundries). Separate packages are provided to load each font for use as main text font. The packages helvet (which allows Helvetica to be loaded with its size scaled to something more nearly appropriate for its use as a Sans-Serif font to match Times) and pifont (which provides the means to select single glyphs from symbol fonts) are tailored to special requirements of their fonts. Mathematics are covered by the mathptmx package, which constructs passable mathematics from a combination of Times Roman, Symbol and some glyphs from Computer Modern, and by Pazo Math (optionally extended with the fpl small-caps and old-style figures fonts) which uses Palatino as base font, with the mathpazo fonts.

"Pst-cox is a PSTricks package for drawing 2-dimensional projections of complex regular polytopes (after the work of Coxeter). The package consists of a macro library for drawing the projections. The complex polytopes appear in the study of the root systems and play a crucial role in many domains related to mathematics and physics. These polytopes have been completely described by Coxeter in his book \"Regular Complex Polytopes\". There exist only a finite numbers of exceptional regular complex polytopes (for example the icosahedron) and some infinite series (for example, one can construct a multi- dimensional analogue of the hypercube in any finite dimension). The library contains two packages. The first, pst-coxcoor, is devoted to the exceptional complex regular polytopes whose coordinates have been pre-computed. The second, pst-coxeterp, is devoted to the infinite series.\n"

"Produce Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF) from a one- page PostScript document, or any PostScript document. A correct Bounding Box is calculated for the EPS files and some PostScript command sequences that can produce errorneous results on printers are filtered. The input is cropped to include just the image contained in the PostScript file. The EPS files can then be included into TeX documents. Other programs like ps2epsi (a script distributed with ghostscript) don't always calculate the correct bounding box (because the values are put on the PostScript stack which may get corrupted by bad PostScript code) or they round it off, resulting in clipping the image. Therefore ps2eps uses a resolution of 144 dpi to get the correct bounding box. The bundle includes binaries for Linux, Solaris, Digital Unix or Windows 2000/9x/NT; for other platforms, the user needs perl, ghostscript and an ANSI-C compiler. Included in the distribution is the bbox program, an application to produce Bounding Box values for rawppm or rawpbm format files.\n"

#. leap/texlive-selnolig/description

"The package suppresses typographic ligatures selectively, i.e., based on predefined search patterns. The search patterns focus on ligatures deemed inappropriate because they span morpheme boundaries. For example, the word shelfful, which is mentioned in the TeXbook as a word for which the ff ligature might be inappropriate, is automatically typeset as shelf\\/ful rather than as shel{ff}ul. For English and German language documents, the package provides extensive rules for the selective suppression of so-called \"common\" ligatures. These comprise the ff, fi, fl, ffi, and ffl ligatures as well as the ft and fft ligatures. Other f-ligatures, such as fb, fh, fj and fk, are suppressed globally, while exceptions are made for names and words of non-English/German origin, such as Kafka and fjord. For English language documents, the package further provides ligature suppression macros for a number of so-called \"discretionary\" or \"rare\" ligatures such as ct, st, and sp. The package requires use of a recent LuaLaTeX format (for example TeXLive2012 or 2013, or MiKTeX2.9).\n"

However, different countries and publishers have differing conventions on the exact appearance of numbers (and units). A number of LaTeX packages have been developed to provide consistent application of the various rules: SIunits, sistyle, unitsdef and units are the leading examples. The numprint package provides a large number of number-related functions, while dcolumn and rccol provide tools for typesetting tabular numbers. The siunitx package takes the best from the existing packages, and adds new features and a consistent interface. A number of new ideas have been incorporated, to fill gaps in the existing provision. The package also provides backward-compatibility with SIunits, sistyle, unitsdef and units. The aim is to have one package to handle all of the possible unit-related needs of LaTeX users.

"The TeX-GYRE bundle consists of six font families: TeX Gyre Adventor is based on the URW Gothic L family of fonts (which is derived from ITC Avant Garde Gothic, designed by Herb Lubalin and Tom Carnase). TeX Gyre Bonum is based on the URW Bookman L family (from Bookman Old Style, designed by Alexander Phemister). TeX Gyre Chorus is based on URW Chancery L Medium Italic (from ITC Zapf Chancery, designed by Hermann Zapf in 1979). TeX-Gyre Cursor is based on URW Nimbus Mono L (based on Courier, designed by Howard G. Kettler in 1955, for IBM). TeX Gyre Heros is based on URW Nimbus Sans L (from Helvetica, prepared by Max Miedinger, with Eduard Hoffmann in 1957). TeX Gyre Pagella is based on URW Palladio L (from Palation, designed by Hermann Zapf in the 1940s). TeX Gyre Schola is based on the URW Century Schoolbook L family (which was designed by Morris Fuller Benton for the American Type Founders). TeX Gyre Termes is based on the URW Nimbus Roman No9 L family of fonts (whose original, Times, was designed by Stanley Morison together with Starling Burgess and Victor Lardent and first offered by Monotype). The constituent standard faces of each family have been greatly extended, and contain nearly 1200 glyphs each (though Chorus omits Greek support, has no small-caps family and has approximately 900 glyphs). Each family is available in Adobe Type 1 and Open Type formats, and LaTeX support (for use with a variety of encodings) is provided. Vietnamese and Cyrillic characters were added by Han The Thanh and Valek Filippov, respectively.\n"

"LaTeX, by default, restricts the sizes at which you can use its default computer modern fonts, to a fixed set of discrete sizes (effectively, a set specified by Knuth).

In fact, since modern distributions will automatically generate any bitmap font you might need, type1cm has wider application than just those using scaleable versions of the fonts. Note that the LaTeX distribution now contains a package fix-cm, which performs the task of type1cm, as well as doing the same job for T1- and TS1-encoded ec fonts.\n"

"Xdoc is a project to rewrite the implementation of the LaTeX doc package (in a broader sense) to make its features more general and flexible. For example, where doc only provides commands for documenting macros and environments, xdoc also provides commands for similarly documenting package options and switches. This is furthermore done in such a way that it is very easy to add more such commands for documenting things, such as e.g., templates (an important concept in the future LaTeX3) and program components for other languages (functions, classes, procedures, etc.). A side effect is that many minor bugs in doc are fixed. The design aims to take advantage of many still experimental features of future versions of LaTeX, but since these are neither reasonably stable nor widely available, the configuration interfaces and package author commands of xdoc are likely to change. To still provide a stable interface for other packages to build upon, the actual package names include a \"major version number\" of sorts. The drop-in replacement package for standard doc is xdoc2; it requires nothing outside standard LaTeX2e. The docindex/docidx2e package changes the index and list of changes typesetting so that none of the formatting has to be controlled via the index style file. The docindex package provides control of formatting via templates (nice interface, but requires several experimental packages), whereas the docidx2e package has traditional raw macro interfaces and works with standard LaTeX2e.\n"
