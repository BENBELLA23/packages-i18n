"The library also provides conventional graph data structures, such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-AdjacencyMap.html Algebra.Graph.AdjacencyMap> along with its various flavours: adjacency maps specialised to graphs with vertices of type 'Int' (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-AdjacencyIntMap.html Algebra.Graph.AdjacencyIntMap>), non-empty adjacency maps (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-NonEmpty-AdjacencyMap.html Algebra.Graph.NonEmpty.AdjacencyMap>), and adjacency maps with edge labels (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-Labelled-AdjacencyMap.html Algebra.Graph.Labelled.AdjacencyMap>). A large part of the API of algebraic graphs and adjacency maps is available through the 'Foldable'-like type class <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/algebraic-graphs/docs/Algebra-Graph-ToGraph.html Algebra.Graph.ToGraph>.\n"

"* 'printf' (from 'Text.Printf') takes a formatting string and uses some type tricks to accept the rest of the arguments polyvariadically. It's very concise, but there are some drawbacks – it can't produce 'Text' (you'd have to 'T.pack' it every time) and it doesn't warn you at compile-time if you pass wrong arguments or not enough of them. \n"
"* <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-format text-format> takes a formatting string with curly braces denoting places where arguments would be substituted (the arguments themselves are provided via a tuple). If you want to apply formatting to some of the arguments, you have to use one of the provided formatters. Like 'printf', it can fail at runtime, but at least the formatters are first-class (and you can add new ones). \n"
"* <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/formatting formatting> takes a formatting template consisting of pieces of strings interleaved with formatters; this ensures that arguments always match their placeholders. 'formatting' provides lots of formatters and generally seems to be the most popular formatting library here. Unfortunately, at least in my experience writing new formatters can be awkward and people sometimes have troubles understanding how 'formatting' works. \n"
"* <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fmt fmt> (i.e. this library) provides formatters that are ordinary functions, and a bunch of operators for concatenating formatted strings; those operators also do automatic conversion. There are some convenience formatters which aren't present in 'formatting' (like ones for formatting maps, lists, converting to base64, etc).

"If 'f' is a 'Functor' then the free 'Monad' on 'f' is the type of trees whose nodes are labeled with the constructors of 'f'. The word \"free\" is used in the sense of \"unrestricted\" rather than \"zero-cost\": 'Free f' makes no constraining assumptions beyond those given by 'f' and the definition of 'Monad'. As used here it is a standard term from the mathematical theory of adjoint functors.\n"

"This package provides functionality for generalising the deriving mechanism in Haskell to arbitrary classes. It was first described in the paper: \n"
"* /A generic deriving mechanism for Haskell/. Jose Pedro Magalhaes, Atze Dijkstra, Johan Jeuring, and Andres Loeh. Haskell'10.\n"
"\n"
"The current implementation integrates with the new GHC Generics. See <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC.Generics> for more information. Template Haskell code is provided for supporting older GHCs.\n"
"\n"
"This library is organized as follows: \n"
"* \"Generics.Deriving.Base\" defines the core functionality for GHC generics, including the 'Generic(1)' classes and representation data types. On modern versions of GHC, this simply re-exports \"GHC.Generics\" from 'base'. On older versions of GHC, this module backports parts of \"GHC.Generics\" that were not included at the time, including 'Generic(1)' instances. \n"
"* \"Generics.Deriving.TH\" implements Template Haskell functionality for deriving instances of 'Generic(1)'. \n"
"* Educational code: in order to provide examples of how to define and use \"GHC.Generics\"-based defaults, this library offers a number of modules which define examples of type classes along with default implementations for the classes' methods. Currently, the following modules are provided: \"Generics.Deriving.Copoint\", \"Generics.Deriving.ConNames\", \"Generics.Deriving.Enum\", \"Generics.Deriving.Eq\", \"Generics.Deriving.Foldable\", \"Generics.Deriving.Functor\", \"Generics.Deriving.Monoid\", \"Generics.Deriving.Semigroup\", \"Generics.Deriving.Show\", \"Generics.Deriving.Traversable\", and \"Generics.Deriving.Uniplate\".\n"
"\n"
"It is worth emphasizing that these modules are primarly intended for educational purposes. Many of the classes in these modules resemble other commonly used classes—for example, 'GShow' from \"Generics.Deriving.Show\" resembles 'Show' from 'base'—but in general, the classes that 'generic-deriving' defines are not drop-in replacements. Moreover, the generic defaults that 'generic-deriving' provide often make simplifying assumptions that may violate expectations of how these classes might work elsewhere. For example, the generic default for 'GShow' does not behave exactly like 'deriving Show' would.\n"
"\n"
"If you are seeking \"GHC.Generics\"-based defaults for type classes in 'base', consider using the '<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-data generic-data>' library. \n"
"* \"Generics.Deriving.Default\" provides newtypes that allow leveraging the generic defaults in this library using the 'DerivingVia' GHC language extension. \n"

msgid ""
"This package provides a couple of different implementations of mutable hash tables in the ST monad, as well as a typeclass abstracting their common operations, and a set of wrappers to use the hash tables in the IO monad.\n"
"\n"
"/QUICK START/: documentation for the hash table operations is provided in the \"Data.HashTable.Class\" module, and the IO wrappers (which most users will probably prefer) are located in the \"Data.HashTable.IO\" module.\n"
"\n"
"This package currently contains three hash table implementations:\n"
"\n"
"1. \"Data.HashTable.ST.Cuckoo\" contains an implementation of \"cuckoo hashing\" as introduced by Pagh and Rodler in 2001 (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_hashing>). Cuckoo hashing has worst-case /O(1)/ lookups and can reach a high \"load factor\", in which the table can perform acceptably well even when approaching 90% full. Randomized testing shows this implementation of cuckoo hashing to be slightly faster on insert and slightly slower on lookup than \"Data.HashTable.ST.Basic\", while being more space efficient by about a half-word per key-value mapping. Cuckoo hashing, like the basic hash table implementation using linear probing, can suffer from long delays when the table is resized.\n"
"\n"
"2. \"Data.HashTable.ST.Basic\" contains a basic open-addressing hash table using linear probing as the collision strategy. On a pure speed basis it should currently be the fastest available Haskell hash table implementation for lookups, although it has a higher memory overhead than the other tables and can suffer from long delays when the table is resized because all of the elements in the table need to be rehashed.\n"
"\n"
"3. \"Data.HashTable.ST.Linear\" contains a linear hash table (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_hashing>), which trades some insert and lookup performance for higher space efficiency and much shorter delays when expanding the table. In most cases, benchmarks show this table to be currently slightly faster than 'Data.HashTable' from the Haskell base library.\n"
"\n"
"It is recommended to create a concrete type alias in your code when using this package, i.e.:\n"
"\n"
"> import qualified Data.HashTable.IO as H > > type HashTable k v = H.BasicHashTable k v > > foo :: IO (HashTable Int Int) > foo = do > ht <- H.new > H.insert ht 1 1 > return ht\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, this makes it easy to switch to a different hash table implementation, and secondly, using a concrete type rather than leaving your functions abstract in the HashTable class should allow GHC to optimize away the typeclass dictionaries.\n"
"\n"
"This package accepts a couple of different cabal flags: \n"
"* 'unsafe-tricks', default /ON/. If this flag is enabled, we use some unsafe GHC-specific tricks to save indirections (namely 'unsafeCoerce#' and 'reallyUnsafePtrEquality#'. These techniques rely on assumptions about the behaviour of the GHC runtime system and, although they've been tested and should be safe under normal conditions, are slightly dangerous. Caveat emptor. In particular, these techniques are incompatible with HPC code coverage reports. \n"
"* 'sse42', default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, we use some SSE 4.2 instructions (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4>, first available on Intel Core 2 processors) to speed up cache-line searches for cuckoo hashing. \n"
"* 'bounds-checking', default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, array accesses are bounds-checked. \n"
"* 'debug', default /OFF/. If turned on, we'll rudely spew debug output to stdout. \n"
"* 'portable', default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, we use only pure Haskell code and try not to use unportable GHC extensions. Turning this flag on forces 'unsafe-tricks' and 'sse42' /OFF/.\n"

The library makes extensive use of the arrow approach for processing XML. Since version 9 the toolbox is partitioned into various (sub-)packages. This package contains the core functionality, hxt-curl, hxt-tagsoup, hxt-relaxng, hxt-xpath, hxt-xslt, hxt-regex-xmlschema contain the extensions. hxt-unicode contains encoding and decoding functions, hxt-charproperties char properties for unicode and XML.

"\n"
"This library is an extract from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> (with no dependencies). It's not a toy lenses library, unsuitable for “real world”, but merely a small one. It is compatible with lens, and should have same performance. It also has better documentation.\n"

"\n"
"Here are some usecases for this library: \n"
"* You want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but don't want to depend on lens. Having lenses available often make working with a library more pleasant. \n"
"* You just want to be able to use lenses to transform data (or even just use 'over _1' to change the first element of a tuple). \n"
"* You are new to lenses and want a small library to play with.\n"
"\n"
"However, don't use this library if: \n"
"* You need 'Iso's, 'Prism's, indexed traversals, or actually anything else which isn't defined here (though some indexed functions are available elsewhere – containers and vector provide them for their types, and <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ilist ilist> provides indexed functions for lists). \n"
"* You want a library with a clean, understandable implementation (in which case you're looking for <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-simple lens-simple>).\n"
"\n"
"As already mentioned, if you're writing an application which uses lenses more extensively, look at <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-platform microlens-platform> – it combines features of most other microlens packages (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-mtl microlens-mtl>, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-th microlens-th>, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-ghc microlens-ghc>).\n"

This implementation is based on Ralf Hinze's <http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/hinze01simple.html A Simple Implementation Technique for Priority Search Queues>. Hence, it is similar to the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/PSQueue PSQueue> library, although it is considerably faster and provides a slightly different API. \n"
"* 'IntPSQ p v' is a far more efficient implementation. It fixes the key type to 'Int' and uses a <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree radix tree> (like 'IntMap') with an additional min-heap property. \n"
"* 'HashPSQ k p v' is a fairly straightforward extension of 'IntPSQ': it simply uses the keys' hashes as indices in the 'IntPSQ'. If there are any hash collisions, it uses an 'OrdPSQ' to resolve those. The performance of this implementation is comparable to that of 'IntPSQ', but it is more widely applicable since the keys are not restricted to 'Int', but rather to any 'Hashable' datatype.\n"

"Provides a wide array of (semi)groupoids and operations for working with them.\n"

"A 'Semigroupoid' is a 'Category' without the requirement of identity arrows for every object in the category.\n"
"\n"
"A 'Category' is any 'Semigroupoid' for which the Yoneda lemma holds.\n"
"\n"
"When working with comonads you often have the '<*>' portion of an 'Applicative', but not the 'pure'. This was captured in Uustalu and Vene's \"Essence of Dataflow Programming\" in the form of the 'ComonadZip' class in the days before 'Applicative'. Apply provides a weaker invariant, but for the comonads used for data flow programming (found in the streams package), this invariant is preserved. Applicative function composition forms a semigroupoid.\n"
"\n"
"Similarly many structures are nearly a comonad, but not quite, for instance lists provide a reasonable 'extend' operation in the form of 'tails', but do not always contain a value.\n"
"\n"
"Ideally the following relationships would hold:\n"
"\n"
"> Foldable ----> Traversable <--- Functor ------> Alt ---------> Plus Semigroupoid > | | | | | > v v v v v > Foldable1 ---> Traversable1 Apply\n"
"--------> Applicative -> Alternative Category > | | | | > v v v v > Bind\n"

"\n"
"Apply, Bind, and Extend (not shown) give rise the Static, Kleisli and Cokleisli semigroupoids respectively.\n"
"\n"
"This lets us remove many of the restrictions from various monad transformers as in many cases the binding operation or '<*>' operation does not require them.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, to work with these weaker structures it is beneficial to have containers that can provide stronger guarantees about their contents, so versions of 'Traversable' and 'Foldable' that can be folded with just a 'Semigroup' are added."

msgid ""
"This package contains two modules, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming/docs/Streaming.html Streaming> and <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming/docs/Streaming-Prelude.html Streaming.Prelude>. The principal module, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-0.1.4.3/docs/Streaming-Prelude.html Streaming.Prelude>, exports an elementary streaming prelude focused on a simple \"source\" or \"producer\" type, namely 'Stream (Of a) m r'. This is a sort of effectful version of '([a],r)' in which successive elements of type 'a' arise from some sort of monadic action before the succession ends with a value of type 'r'. Everything in the library is organized to make programming with this type as simple as possible, by the simple expedient of making it as close to 'Prelude' and 'Data.List' as possible. Thus for example the trivial program\n"
"\n"
"> >>> S.sum $ S.take 3 (S.readLn :: Stream (Of Int) IO ()) > 1<Enter> > 2<Enter> > 3<Enter> > 6 :> ()\n"
"\n"
"sums the first three valid integers from user input. Similarly,\n"
"\n"
"> >>> S.stdoutLn $ S.map (map toUpper) $ S.take 2 S.stdinLn > hello<Enter> > HELLO > world!<Enter> > WORLD!\n"
"\n"
"upper-cases the first two lines from stdin as they arise, and sends them to stdout. And so on, with filtering, mapping, breaking, chunking, zipping, unzipping, replicating and so forth: we program with streams of 'Int's or 'String's directly as if they constituted something like a list. That's because streams really do constitute something like a list, and the associated operations can mostly have the same names. (A few, like 'reverse', don't stream and thus disappear; others like 'unzip' are here given properly streaming formulation for the first time.) And we everywhere oppose \"extracting a pure list from IO\", which is the origin of typical Haskell memory catastrophes. Basically any case where you are tempted to use 'mapM', 'replicateM', 'traverse' or 'sequence' with Haskell lists, you would do better to use something like 'Stream (Of a) m r'. The type signatures are a little fancier, but the programs themselves are mostly the same. /In fact, they are mostly simpler./ Thus, consider the trivial demo program mentioned in <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24068399/haskell-performance-of-iorefs this SO question>\n"
"\n"
"> main = mapM newIORef [1..10^8::Int] >>= mapM readIORef >>= mapM_ print\n"
"\n"
"The new user notices that this exhausts memory, and worries about the efficiency of Haskell 'IORefs'. But of course it exhausts memory! Look what it says! The problem is immediately cured by writing\n"
"\n"
"> main = S.print $ S.mapM readIORef $ S.mapM newIORef $ S.each [1..10^8::Int]\n"
"\n"
"which really does what the other program was meant to do, uses no more memory than 'hello-world', /and is simpler anyway/, since it doesn't involve the detour of \"extracting a list from IO\". Almost every use of list 'mapM', 'replicateM', 'traverse' and 'sequence' produces this problem on a smaller scale. People get used to it, as if it were characteristic of Haskell programs to use a lot of memory. But in truth \"extracting a list or sequence from IO\" is mostly just bad practice pure and simple. Of course, 'mapM', 'replicateM', 'traverse' and 'sequence' make sense for lists, under certain conditions! But 'unsafePerformIO' also makes sense under certain conditions.\n"
"\n"
"The <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-0.1.4.3/docs/Streaming.html Streaming> module exports the general type, 'Stream f m r', which can be used to stream successive distinct steps characterized by /any/ functor 'f', though we are mostly interested in organizing computations of the form 'Stream (Of a) m r'. The streaming-IO libraries have various devices for dealing with effectful variants of '[a]' or '([a],r)' in which the emergence of successive elements somehow depends on IO. But it is only with the general type 'Stream f m r', or some equivalent, that one can envisage (for example) the connected streaming of their sorts of stream - as one makes lists of lists in the Haskell 'Prelude' and 'Data.List'. One needs some such type if we are to express properly streaming equivalents of e.g.\n"
"\n"
"> group :: Ord a => [a] -> [[a]] > chunksOf :: Int -> [a] -> [[a]] > lines :: [Char] -> [[Char]] -- but similarly with byte streams, etc.\n"
"\n"
"to mention a few obviously desirable operations. (This is explained more elaborately in the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming#readme readme> below.)\n"
"\n"
"One could of course throw something like the present 'Stream' type on top of a prior stream concept: this is how 'pipes' and 'pipes-group' (which are very much our model here) use 'FreeT'. But once one grasps the iterable stream concept needed to express those functions then one will also see that, with it, one is /already/ in possession of a complete elementary streaming library - since one possesses 'Stream ((,) a) m r' or equivalently 'Stream (Of a) m r'. This is the type of a 'generator' or 'producer' or 'source' or whatever you call an effectful stream of items. /The present Streaming.Prelude is thus the simplest streaming library that can replicate anything like the API of the Prelude and Data.List/.\n"
"\n"
"The emphasis of the library is on interoperation; for the rest its advantages are: extreme simplicity, re-use of intuitions the user has gathered from mastery of 'Prelude' and 'Data.List', and a total and systematic rejection of type synonyms. The two conceptual pre-requisites are some comprehension of monad transformers and some familiarity with 'rank 2 types'. It is hoped that experimentation with this simple material, starting with the ghci examples in 'Streaming.Prelude', will give people who are new to these concepts some intuition about their importance. The most fundamental purpose of the library is to express elementary streaming ideas without reliance on a complex framework, but in a way that integrates transparently with the rest of Haskell, using ideas - e.g. rank 2 types, which are here implicit or explicit in most mapping - that the user can carry elsewhere, rather than chaining her understanding to the curiosities of a so-called streaming IO framework (as necessary as that is for certain purposes.)\n"
"\n"
"See the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming#readme readme> below for further explanation, including the examples linked there. Elementary usage can be divined from the ghci examples in 'Streaming.Prelude' and perhaps from this rough beginning of a <https://github.com/michaelt/streaming-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.md tutorial>. Note also the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-bytestring streaming bytestring> and <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-utils streaming utils> packages. Questions about usage can be put raised on StackOverflow with the tag '[haskell-streaming]', or as an issue on Github, or on the <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskell-pipes pipes list> (the package understands itself as part of the pipes 'ecosystem'.)\n"
"\n"
"The simplest form of interoperation with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes pipes> is accomplished with this isomorphism:\n"
"\n"
"> Pipes.unfoldr Streaming.next :: Stream (Of a) m r -> Producer a m r > Streaming.unfoldr Pipes.next :: Producer a m r -> Stream (Of a) m r\n"
"\n"
"Interoperation with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams io-streams> is thus:\n"
"\n"
"> Streaming.reread IOStreams.read :: InputStream a -> Stream (Of a) IO () > IOStreams.unfoldM Streaming.uncons :: Stream (Of a) IO () -> IO (InputStream a)\n"
"\n"
"With <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit conduit> one might use, e.g.:\n"
"\n"
"> Conduit.unfoldM Streaming.uncons :: Stream (Of a) m () -> Source m a > str -> Streaming.mapM_ Conduit.yield (hoist lift str) :: Stream (Of o) m r -> ConduitM i o m r > src -> hoist lift str $$ Conduit.mapM_ Streaming.yield :: Source m a\n"
"-> Stream (Of a) m ()\n"
"\n"
"These conversions should never be more expensive than a single '>->' or '=$='. The simplest interoperation with regular Haskell lists is provided by, say\n"
"\n"
"> Streaming.each :: [a] -> Stream (Of a) m () > Streaming.toList_ :: Stream (Of a) m r -> m [a]\n"
"\n"
"The latter of course accumulates the whole list in memory, and is mostly what we are trying to avoid. Every use of 'Prelude.mapM f' should be reconceived as using the composition 'Streaming.toList_ . Streaming.mapM f . Streaming.each' with a view to considering whether the accumulation required by 'Streaming.toList_' is really necessary.\n"
"\n"
"Here are the results of some <https://gist.github.com/michaelt/96606bbf05b29bf43a05aba081dc9bd4#file-benchmachines-hs microbenchmarks> based on the <https://github.com/ekmett/machines/blob/master/benchmarks/Benchmarks.hs benchmarks> included in the machines package:\n"

"This package provides strict versions of some standard Haskell data types (pairs, Maybe and Either). It also contains strict IO operations.\n"
"\n"
"It is common knowledge that lazy datastructures can lead to space-leaks. This problem is particularly prominent, when using lazy datastructures to store the state of a long-running application in memory. One common solution to this problem is to use 'seq' and its variants in every piece of code that updates your state. However a much easier solution is to use fully strict types to store such state values. By \"fully strict types\" we mean types for whose values it holds that, if they are in weak-head normal form, then they are also in normal form. Intuitively, this means that values of fully strict types cannot contain unevaluated thunks.\n"
"\n"
"To define a fully strict datatype, one typically uses the following recipe.\n"
"\n"
"1. Make all fields of every constructor strict; i.e., add a bang to all fields.\n"
"\n"
"2. Use only strict types for the fields of the constructors.\n"
"\n"
"The second requirement is problematic as it rules out the use of the standard Haskell 'Maybe', 'Either', and pair types. This library solves this problem by providing strict variants of these types and their corresponding standard support functions and type-class instances.\n"
"\n"
"Note that this library does currently not provide fully strict lists. They can be added if they are really required. However, in many cases one probably wants to use unboxed or strict boxed vectors from the 'vector' library (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector>) instead of strict lists. Moreover, instead of 'String's one probably wants to use strict 'Text' values from the 'text' library (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text>).\n"
