"QTermWidget is a project based on the KDE4 Konsole application whose goal is "
"to provide a Unicode- enabled, embeddable Qt widget to be used as a built-in "
"console (or terminal emulation widget). Though Konsole is able of getting "
"embedded, it is possible to have Qt without KDE. The original Konsole code "
"was rewritten entirely with using Qt only, and all code dealing with user "
"interface parts and session management was removed."
