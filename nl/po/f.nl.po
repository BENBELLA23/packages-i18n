"A file system referral is like a symbolic link to another file system share, "

"Today, file system referral mechanisms exist in several network file system "
"protocols. FedFS provides its namespace features by leveraging referral "
"mechanisms already built in to network file system protocols. Thus no change "
"to file system protocols or clients is required.\n"
"\n"

"referrals. More on NFS version 4 referrals can be found in RFC 3530. FedFS "

"This package contains files common to all of the fedfs packages.\n"

"RFC 5716 introduces the Federated File System (FedFS, for short). FedFS is "
"an extensible standardized mechanism by which system administrators "
"construct a coherent namespace across multiple file servers using file "
"system referrals.\n"
"\n"
"A file system referral is like a symbolic link to another file system share, "
"but it is not visible to applications. It behaves like an automounted "
"directory where a new file system mount is done when an application first "
"accesses that directory. The arguments of the mount operation are controlled "
"by information returned by the file server.\n"
"\n"
"Today, file system referral mechanisms exist in several network file system "
"protocols. FedFS provides its namespace features by leveraging referral "
"mechanisms already built in to network file system protocols. Thus no change "
"to file system protocols or clients is required.\n"
"\n"
"Currently, the Linux FedFS implementation supports only NFS version 4 "
"referrals. More on NFS version 4 referrals can be found in RFC 3530. FedFS "
"may support other network file system protocols in the future."
