"The ScaLAPACK (or Scalable LAPACK) library includes a subset of LAPACK "

"laid out in a two-dimensional block cyclic decomposition.\n"
"\n"
"ScaLAPACK is designed for heterogeneous computing and is portable on any "

"to the hierarchy of registers, cache, and local memory on each processor.) "

"Linear Algebra Communication Subprograms (BLACS) for communication tasks "
"that arise frequently in parallel linear algebra computations. In the "
