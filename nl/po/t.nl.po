"Torsocks allows you to use most applications in a safe way with Tor. It "
"ensures that DNS requests are handled safely and explicitly rejects any "
"traffic other than TCP from the application you're using.\n"
"\n"
"Torsocks is an ELF shared library that is loaded before all others. The "
"library overrides every needed Internet communication libc function calls "
"such as connect(2) or gethostbyname(3).\n"
"\n"
"This process is transparent to the user and if torsocks detects any "
"communication that can't go through the Tor network such as UDP traffic, for "
"instance, the connection is denied. If, for any reason, there is no way for "
"torsocks to provide the Tor anonymity guarantee to your application, "
"torsocks will force the application to quit and stop everything.\n"
"\n"
"Adjust when needed /etc/tor/torsocks.conf and use Torsocks with\n"
"\n"
"    torsocks application\n"
"\n"
"So, for example you can use ssh to a some.ssh.com by doing\n"
"\n"
"    torsocks ssh -p SSH-Port -i ~/.ssh/ssh-key.rsa username@some.ssh.com\n"

"You can use in /etc/bash.bashrc.local or /etc/zsh.zshrc.local alias\n"
"\n"
"    alias slogin-='torsocks slogin'\n"

"\n"
"    slogin- server\n"

"Tycho is a set of Maven plugins and extensions for building Eclipse plugins "
"and OSGI bundles with Maven. Eclipse plugins and OSGI bundles have their own "
"metadata for expressing dependencies, source folder locations, etc. that are "
"normally found in a Maven POM. Tycho uses native metadata for Eclipse "
"plugins and OSGi bundles and uses the POM to configure and drive the build. "
"Tycho supports bundles, fragments, features, update site projects and RCP "
"applications. Tycho also knows how to run JUnit test plugins using OSGi "
"runtime and there is also support for sharing build results using Maven "
"artifact repositories.\n"
"\n"
"Tycho plugins introduce new packaging types and the corresponding lifecycle "
"bindings that allow Maven to use OSGi and Eclipse metadata during a Maven "
"build. OSGi rules are used to resolve project dependencies and package "
"visibility restrictions are honored by the OSGi-aware JDT-based compiler "
"plugin. Tycho will use OSGi metadata and OSGi rules to calculate project "
"dependencies dynamically and injects them into the Maven project model at "
"build time. Tycho supports all attributes supported by the Eclipse OSGi "
"resolver (Require-Bundle, Import-Package, Eclipse-GenericRequire, etc). "
"Tycho will use proper classpath access rules during compilation. Tycho "
"supports all project types supported by PDE and will use PDE/JDT project "
"metadata where possible. One important design goal in Tycho is to make sure "
"there is no duplication of metadata between POM and OSGi metadata."
