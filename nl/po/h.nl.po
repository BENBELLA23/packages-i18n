"'hdevtools' is a backend for text editor plugins, to allow for things such "
"as syntax and type checking of Haskell code, and retrieving type "
"information, all directly from within your text editor.\n"
"\n"
"The advantage that 'hdevtools' has over competitors, is that it runs "
"silently in a persistent background process, and therefore is able to keeps "
"all of your Haskell modules and dependent libraries loaded in memory. This "
"way, when you change only a single source file, only it needs to be reloaded "
"and rechecked, instead of having to reload everything.\n"
"\n"
"This makes 'hdevtools' very fast for checking syntax and type errors (runs "
"just as fast as the ':reload' command in GHCi).\n"
"\n"
"In fact, syntax and type checking is so fast, that you can safely enable "
"auto checking on every save. Even for huge projects, checking is nearly "
"instant.\n"
"\n"
"Once you start using 'hdevtools' and you get used to having your errors "
"shown to you instantly (without having to switch back and forth between GHCi "
"and your editor), and shown directly on your code, in your editor (without "
"having to wait forever for GHC to run) you will wonder how you ever lived "
"without it.\n"
"\n"
"In addition to checking Haskell source code for errors, 'hdevtools' has "
"tools for getting info about identifiers, and getting type information for "
"snippets of code."
