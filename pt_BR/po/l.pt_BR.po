"simultaneously in the background. With LFTP, you can start a transfer in the "
"background and continue browsing that FTP site or another one. This is all "
"done in one process. Background jobs are completed in nohup mode if you exit "
"or close the modem connection. LFTP has reput, mirror, and reverse mirror "
"among its features. Since version 2.0, it also supports the HTTP protocol. "
"Other features include IPV6 support, context sensitive completion, output "
"redirection to files or to pipe, FTP and HTTP proxy support, transfer rate "
"throttling for each connection and for all connections in sum, job queueing, "
"job execution at specified times, opie and skey support in the FTP protocol, "

"\" to accommodate the needs of real software as they arise.\n"
"\n"
"LV2 is both a stable interface and a forward-moving project: there is a "
"stable set of \"official\" extensions in use while new functionality is "
"actively developed. Anyone can extend LV2, which allows developers to try "
"out new ideas and ensure they work in practice. Good extensions are vetted "
"by the community and included in the official distribution so they can be "
"relied on to be widely supported. This open development model means "
"developers can always scratch their itch without a central authority getting "
"in the way. The current stable release includes most functionality required "
"by modern plugins, including:\n"
"\n"
"  * Audio, control, \"control voltage\" (audio-rate control), and event     "
"(e.g. MIDI) input and output   * Expressive open-ended port metadata, "
"including:     - \"Meaningful\" controls (e.g. gain or envelope attack) "
"allowing intelligent       host control or UI generation     - Control units "
"(e.g. Hz, octaves, dB)     - Multi-channel port groups (e.g. stereo, 5.1 "
"surround, ambisonics   * Embeddable GUIs in any toolkit, with support for a "
"full plugin/UI split     (including network transparency in capable hosts)   "
"* Ability to bundle any files (e.g. samples or impulses) with plugins   * "
"Presets (bundled and/or user saved)   * Plugin state saving and restoring   "
"* Host-managed logging   * Non-realtime plugin worker methods (simple and "
"portable host-managed     threading)   * Message-based plugin communication, "
"allowing plugins/UIs to have advanced     interfaces without host support or "
"specifications getting in the way   * Transport awareness, both real time "
"and tempo time (bars, beats, etc-.)\n"
"\n"
"LV2 has graceful compatibility \"baked in\": for example, a simple amplifier "
"plugin might have audio in/out with a gain control, and function in any "
"host. The same plugin could have a fancy GUI and transport awareness which "
"optionally work in hosts that support these features. Conversely, hosts know "
"not to load plugins that require features it does not support.\n"
"\n"
"See the specification index for complete documentation. If you are a host or "
"plugin author and need missing functionality, please file a ticket or let us "
"know your requirements on  the mailing list. LV2 is a community project that "

"History List is saved to the histfile. Various options can be changed using "
"the set_options{} function. The user can configure the GNU Readline (e.g. vi "
"or emacs keystrokes ?) with their individual ~/.inputrc file, see the "
"INITIALIZATION FILE section of man readline. By default, the GNU readline "
"library dialogues with the user by reading from stdin and writing to stdout; "
"this fits very badly with applications that want to use stdin and stdout to "
"input and output data. Therefore, this Lua module dialogues with the user on "
"the controlling-terminal of the process (typically /dev/tty) as returned by "
"ctermid(). Most of readline's Alternate Interface is now included, namely   "
"handler_install,   read_char   and handler_remove. Some applications need to "
"interleave keyboard I/O with file, device, or window system I/O, typically "
"by using a main loop to select() on various file descriptors.   To "
"accommodate this need, readline can also be invoked as a 'callback' function "
"from an event loop, and the Alternate Interface offers functions to do this. "
"The Alternate Interface does offer tab-completion; but it does not add to "
"the history file, so you will probably want to call RL.add_history(s) "
"explicitly. See handler_install() Access to readline's Custom Completion is "
"now provided. This module does not work lua -i because that runs its own "
"readline, and the two conflict with each other."
