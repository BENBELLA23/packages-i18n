"LHAPDF provides a unified and easy to use interface to modern PDF sets. It "
"is designed to work not only with individual PDF sets but also with the more "
"recent multiple \"error\" sets. It can be viewed as the successor to PDFLIB, "
"incorporating many of the older sets found in the latter, including pion and "
"photon PDFs. In LHAPDF the computer code and input parameters/grids are "
"separated thus allowing more easy updating and no limit to the expansion "
"possibilities. The code and data sets can be downloaded together or "
"inidivually as desired. From version 4.1 onwards a configuration script "

"This package contains four tools for working with OpenType fonts:\n"
"\n"
" cfftot1    allows you to translate Compact Font Format (CFF) or             "
"PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts into PostScript             Type 1 font "
"format\n"
"\n"
" otfinfo    reports information about OpenType fonts, such as "
"the             features they support and the contents of their "
"``size''             optical size option\n"
"\n"
" otftotfm   allows you to create TeX font metrics and encodings "
"for             using OpenType fonts\n"
"\n"
" t1dotlessj creates a Type 1 font with a single character --             the "
"dotless j corresponding to the specified design\n"
"\n"
" t1lint     checks a Type 1 font for correctness (preliminary)\n"
"\n"
" t1reencode reencodes a Type 1 font, replacing its internal encoding "
"with             one you specify\n"
"\n"
" t1testpage creates a PostScript test page for a specified             font "
"file (preliminary)\n"
"\n"
"The package now includes programs for working with multiple-master fonts "
"formerly distributed as mminstance.  These tools allow you to use multiple-"
"master fonts with programs that require single-master fonts (afm2tfm, ps2pk, "
"fontinst, etc.).  Both programs work fine with fonts that contain "
"intermediate masters (e.g., Adobe Jenson MM and Adobe Kepler MM).\n"
"\n"
"mmafm        creates an AFM (Adobe font metric) file corresponding "
"to              a single instance of a multiple-master font.  It "
"reads              (and therefore requires) the AMFM and AFM "
"files              distributed with the font.\n"
"\n"
"mmpfb        creates a normal, single-master font program that "
"looks              like an instance of a multiple-master font.  It "
"reads              the multiple-master font program in PFA or PFB format."

"LV2 is a portable plugin standard for audio systems, similar in scope to "
"LADSPA, VST, AU, and others. It defines a C API for code and a format for "
"data files which collectively describe a plugin. LV2 consists of a simple "
"core (roughly equivalent in power to LADSPA) which can be extended to "
"support more advanced functionality. This allows the interface to be \"grown"
"\" to accommodate the needs of real software as they arise.\n"
"\n"
"LV2 is both a stable interface and a forward-moving project: there is a "
"stable set of \"official\" extensions in use while new functionality is "
"actively developed. Anyone can extend LV2, which allows developers to try "
"out new ideas and ensure they work in practice. Good extensions are vetted "
"by the community and included in the official distribution so they can be "
"relied on to be widely supported. This open development model means "
"developers can always scratch their itch without a central authority getting "
"in the way. The current stable release includes most functionality required "
"by modern plugins, including:\n"
"\n"
"  * Audio, control, \"control voltage\" (audio-rate control), and event     "
"(e.g. MIDI) input and output   * Expressive open-ended port metadata, "
"including:     - \"Meaningful\" controls (e.g. gain or envelope attack) "
"allowing intelligent       host control or UI generation     - Control units "
"(e.g. Hz, octaves, dB)     - Multi-channel port groups (e.g. stereo, 5.1 "
"surround, ambisonics   * Embeddable GUIs in any toolkit, with support for a "
"full plugin/UI split     (including network transparency in capable hosts)   "
"* Ability to bundle any files (e.g. samples or impulses) with plugins   * "
"Presets (bundled and/or user saved)   * Plugin state saving and restoring   "
"* Host-managed logging   * Non-realtime plugin worker methods (simple and "
"portable host-managed     threading)   * Message-based plugin communication, "
"allowing plugins/UIs to have advanced     interfaces without host support or "
"specifications getting in the way   * Transport awareness, both real time "
"and tempo time (bars, beats, etc-.)\n"
"\n"
"LV2 has graceful compatibility \"baked in\": for example, a simple amplifier "
"plugin might have audio in/out with a gain control, and function in any "
"host. The same plugin could have a fancy GUI and transport awareness which "
"optionally work in hosts that support these features. Conversely, hosts know "
"not to load plugins that require features it does not support.\n"
"\n"
"See the specification index for complete documentation. If you are a host or "
"plugin author and need missing functionality, please file a ticket or let us "
"know your requirements on  the mailing list. LV2 is a community project that "
"depends on your feedback to improve - unknown requirements are unmet "
