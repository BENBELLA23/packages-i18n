"Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language: It has "
"inductive families, which are similar to Haskell's GADTs, but they can be "
"indexed by values and not just types. It also has parameterised modules, "
"mixfix operators, Unicode characters, and an interactive Emacs interface "
"(the type checker can assist in the development of your code).\n"
"\n"
"Agda is also a proof assistant: It is an interactive system for writing and "
"checking proofs. Agda is based on intuitionistic type theory, a foundational "
"system for constructive mathematics developed by the Swedish logician Per "
"Martin-L&#xf6;f. It has many similarities with other proof assistants based "
"on dependent types, such as Coq, Epigram and NuPRL.\n"
"\n"
"This package includes both a command-line program (agda) and an Emacs mode. "
"If you want to use the Emacs mode you can set it up by running 'agda-mode "
"setup' (see the README).\n"
"\n"
"Note that the Agda library does not follow the package versioning policy, "
"because it is not intended to be used by third-party packages."

"Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool. In theory, it is kind of like Make, "
"but without Make's wrinkles.\n"
"\n"
"Why another build tool when there is already make, gnumake, nmake, jam, and "
"others? Because all those tools have limitations that Ant's original author "
"could not live with when developing software across multiple platforms. Make-"
"like tools are inherently shell-based--they evaluate a set of dependencies "
"then execute commands, not unlike what you would issue in a shell. This "
"means that you can easily extend these tools by using or writing any program "
"for the OS that you are working on. However, this also means that you limit "
"yourself to the OS, or at least the OS type, such as Unix, that you are "
"working on.\n"
"\n"
"Makefiles are inherently evil as well. Anybody who has worked on them for "
"any time has run into the dreaded tab problem. \"Is my command not executing "
"because I have a space in front of my tab???\" said the original author of "
"Ant way too many times. Tools like Jam took care of this to a great degree, "
"but still have yet another format to use and remember.\n"
"\n"
"Ant is different. Instead of a model where it is extended with shell-based "
"commands, Ant is extended using Java classes. Instead of writing shell "
"commands, the configuration files are XML-based, calling out a target tree "
"where various tasks are executed. Each task is run by an object that "
"implements a particular task interface.\n"
"\n"
"Granted, this removes some of the expressive power that is inherent by being "
"able to construct a shell command such as `find . -name foo -exec rm {}`, "
"but it gives you the ability to be cross-platform--to work anywhere and "
"everywhere. If you really need to execute a shell command, Ant has an <exec> "
"task that allows different commands to be executed based on the OS used."

"Apache processes requests in stages (for example: read the request, parse "

"For most programmers, the request and the authentication handlers provide "
