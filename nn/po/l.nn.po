"support more advanced functionality. This allows the interface to be \"grown"
"\" to accommodate the needs of real software as they arise.\n"
"\n"
"LV2 is both a stable interface and a forward-moving project: there is a "
"stable set of \"official\" extensions in use while new functionality is "
"actively developed. Anyone can extend LV2, which allows developers to try "
"out new ideas and ensure they work in practice. Good extensions are vetted "
"by the community and included in the official distribution so they can be "
"relied on to be widely supported. This open development model means "
"developers can always scratch their itch without a central authority getting "
"in the way. The current stable release includes most functionality required "
"by modern plugins, including:\n"
"\n"
"  * Audio, control, \"control voltage\" (audio-rate control), and event     "
"(e.g. MIDI) input and output   * Expressive open-ended port metadata, "
"including:     - \"Meaningful\" controls (e.g. gain or envelope attack) "
"allowing intelligent       host control or UI generation     - Control units "
"(e.g. Hz, octaves, dB)     - Multi-channel port groups (e.g. stereo, 5.1 "
"surround, ambisonics   * Embeddable GUIs in any toolkit, with support for a "
"full plugin/UI split     (including network transparency in capable hosts)   "
"* Ability to bundle any files (e.g. samples or impulses) with plugins   * "
