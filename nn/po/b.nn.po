"Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides "
"scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java "
"objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write JSPs "
"in languages other than Java while providing access to the Java class "
"library. In addition, BSF permits any Java application to be implemented in "
"part (or dynamically extended) by a language that is embedded within it. "
"This is achieved by providing an API that permits calling scripting language "
"engines from within Java, as well as an object registry that exposes Java "
"objects to these scripting language engines.\n"

"BYACC/J is an extension of the Berkeley v 1.8 YACC-compatible parser "

"C files from it, which if compiled properly, will produce a LALR-grammar "
"parser. This is useful for expression parsing, interactive command parsing, "
"and file reading. Many megabytes of YACC code have been written over the "
"years. This is the standard YACC tool that is in use every day to produce C/C"
"++ parsers. I have added a \"-J\" flag which will cause BYACC to generate "
