"LibTMCG is a C++ library for creating secure and fair online card games. The "
"library contains classes, algorithms, and high-level protocols to support an "
"application programmer in writing such software. Neither a trusted third "
"party (TTP), i.e. a central game server, nor trusted hardware components are "
"necessary. With the library, there is no need for an independent referee, "
"because the applied protocols provide a basic level of confidentiality and "
"fairness by itself. The library is suited for peer-to-peer (P2P) "
"environments where no TTP is available.\n"
"\n"
"It cannot be avoided that malicious players share information about their "
"private cards, but the protocols ensure that the shuffle of the deck is "
"performed randomly (presumed that at least one player is honest) and thus "
"the cards will be distributed uniformly among the players. Further, no "
"coalition can learn the private cards of a player against his will (except "
"for trivial conclusions). The corresponding cryptographic problemis called "
"Mental Poker, and LibTMCG provides an implementation of such protocols.\n"
"\n"
"The implementation relies on cryptographic techniques---the so-called zero-"
"knowledge proofs. Using these building blocks, the high-level protocols "
"minimize the effect of coalitions and preserve the confidentiality of the "
"players' strategy, i.e. the players are not required to reveal their cards "
"at the end of the game to show that they did not cheat."

"top of libarchive. It started as a test harness, but has grown and is now "
"the standard system tar for FreeBSD 5 and 6.\n"
"\n"
"The libarchive library offers a number of features that make it both very "
"flexible and very powerful. \n"
"- Automatic format detection: libarchive can automatically determine    both "
"the compression and the archive format, regardless of the    data source. "
"Most tar implementations do not automatically detect    the compression "
"format, few implementation that can correctly do    this when reading from "
"stdin or a socket. (The tar program    included with Gunnar Ritter's "
"heirloom collection also does full    automatic format detection.) \n"
"- Writes POSIX formats: libarchive writes POSIX-standard formats,    "
"including \"ustar,\" \"pax interchange format,\" and the POSIX \"cpio\"    "
"format. \n"
"- Supports pax interchange format: Pax interchange format (which,    despite "
"the name, is really an extended tar format) eliminates    almost all "
"limitations of historic tar formats and provides a    standard method for "
"incorporating vendor-specific extensions.    libarchive exploits this "
"extension mechanism to support ACLs and    file flags, for example. (Joerg "
"Schilling's star archiver is    another open-source tar program that "
"supports pax interchange    format.) \n"
"- Reads popular formats: libarchive can read GNU tar, ustar, pax    "
"interchange format, cpio, and older tar variants. The internal    "
"architecture is easily extensible. The only requirement for    support is "
"that it be possible to read the format without seeking    in the file. (For "
"example, a format that includes a compressed    size field before the data "
"cannot be correctly written without    seeking.) \n"
"- High-Level API: the libarchive API makes it fairly simple to build    an "
"archive from a list of filenames or to extract the entries    from an "
"archive. However, the API also provides extreme    flexibility with regards "
"to data sources. For example, there are    generic hooks that allow you to "
"write an archive to a socket or    read data from an archive entry into a "
"memory buffer. \n"
"- Extensible. The internal design uses generic interfaces for compression, "
"archive format detection and decoding, and archive data I/O. It should be "
"very easy to add new formats, new compression methods, or new ways of "
"reading/writing archives."

"librelp is an easy to use library for the RELP protocol. RELP in turn "

"RELP (and hence) librelp assures that no message is lost, not even when "

"RELP has a minimal window of opportunity for message duplication after a "
