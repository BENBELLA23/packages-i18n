# openSUSE-packages-i18n
Translations of openSUSE packages descriptions
This repository is set up for migrating these translations from good old svn.opensuse.org instance to the new and shiny Weblate instance at l10n.opensuse.org
All the scripts used to split the main repo descriptions file into gettext messages and preparing the *.pot files for translators will be hosted here as well as translations themselves, which can be made with or without Weblate's help.
