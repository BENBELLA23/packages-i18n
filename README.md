Translations of openSUSE packages descriptions

This repository is set up for migrating package translations from good old svn.opensuse.org instance to the new and shiny Weblate instance at _l10n.opensuse.org_

All the scripts (see 50-tools/) used to split the main repo descriptions file into gettext messages and preparing the *.pot files for translators (see 50-pot/) will be hosted here as well as translations themselves, which can be made with or without Weblate's help.
